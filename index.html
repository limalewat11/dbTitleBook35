The Mises Institute has united this book with its natural complement: a detailed reform proposal for a 100 percent gold dollar. <i>The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar</i> was written a decade before the last vestiges of the gold standard were abolished. His unique plan for making the dollar sound again still holds up. Some people have said: Rothbard tells us what is wrong with money but not what to do about it. Well, by adding this essay, the problem and the answer are united in a comprehensive whole. After presenting the basics of money and banking theory, he traces the decline of the dollar from the 18th century to the present, and provides lucid critiques of central banking, New Deal monetary policy, Nixonian fiat money, and fixed exchange rates. He also provides a blueprint for a return to a 100 percent reserve gold standard. The book made huge theoretical advances. He was the first to prove that the government, and only the government, can destroy money on a mass scale, and he showed exactly how they go about this dirty deed. But just as importantly, it is beautifully written. He tells a thrilling story because he loves the subject so much. The passion that Murray feels for the topic comes through in the prose and transfers to the reader. Readers become excited about the subject, and tell others. Students tell professors. Some, like the great Ron Paul of Texas, have even run for political office after having read it. Rothbard shows precisely how banks create money out of thin air and how the central bank, backed by government power, allows them to get away with it. He shows how exchange rates and interest rates would work in a true free market. When it comes to describing the end of the gold standard, he is not content to describe the big trends. He names names and ferrets out all the interest groups involved. Since Rothbard's death, scholars have worked to assess his legacy, and many of them agree that this little book is one of his most important. Though it has sometimes been inauspiciously packaged and is surprisingly short, its argument took huge strides toward explaining that it is impossible to understand public affairs in our time without understanding money and its destruction.</p><p>Murray N. Rothbard (1926-1995) distinguished himself as an economist, writing a major treatise on theory, several important economic histories, and a highly praised history of economic thought. But he was also known as the pioneer thinker of libertarianism, the political philosophy that roots freedom in private property ownership and decries the state as inherently contrary to the ethics of a free society. Writing from this perspective, he gained a reputation as the most provocative and influential contributor to the anarchist tradition in our century.</p><h2>Original Intentions: On the Making and Ratification of the United States Constitution</h2><p>This persuasively argued, decidedly partisan work aims to recover the original United States Constitution by describing its genesis, ratification, and mandate from the perspectives of its original framers. Openly challenging contemporary orthodoxy, M. E. Bradford employs principles of legal, historical, rhetorical, and dramatic analysis to reveal a Constitution notably short on abstract principles and modest in any goal beyond limiting the powers of the government it authorizes.<br>From the beginning of Original Intentions, two sharply divergent convictions about the Constitution emerge. Bradford, arguing from a nomocratic viewpoint, regards the Constitution as an essentially procedural text created expressly to detail how the government may preside over itself not its people. He decries the currently predominant teleologic view, which is based upon the "principles" embodied by the Constitution, and holds that the document was designed to achieve a certain kind of society. By this view, he says, our fundamental laws have been blanketed by a heavy layer of ad hoc solutions to problems they were never intended to address, and then further obscured by the melioristic meddlings of judges, legislators, lawyers, scholars, and journalists.<br>Bradford first shows that the Constitutional convention of 1787 was an enterprise guided by the delegates' hesitancy to impose a higher order over their local, practical, and vastly differing interests. Though all the states would ratify the Constitution, he says, each would interpret it in unique ways. Bradford underscores the dearth of lofty idealism among the original framers by detailing British influences on their political ethos. British common law, on which the framers heavily relied, evolved from a tradition of deliberate responses to practical needs and circumstances, not deductions from abstract utopian designs. In light of these factors, Bradford examines the ratification debates of Massachusetts, South Carolina, and North Carolina - three states that together exemplified the vast range of interests to be accommodated by the Constitution.<br>Next Bradford highlights classic teleologic distortions. Discussing religion and the first amendment, he establishes a pervasive commitment to Christianity among the framers and challenges our notions about the separation of church and state. Warning against anachronistic readings of the Constitution, Bradford also analyzes the rhetoric of the framers to reinforce our awareness of their desire for a government that would contain their multiplicities, not seek to resolve them. In a reading of the Reconstruction amendments (thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen) Bradford argues that they had only a modest impact on the Constitution's original design. By the misconstruction of these amendments, however, the Constitution has been transformed into "a purpose oriented blank check for redesigning American society." In a final chapter Bradford critiques Mortimer Adler's We Hold These Truths and repudiates any broad connection between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.<br>Before the Constitution is irreparably damaged, Bradford says, we must realize that it was not the best that the framers could invent but the best that their constituencies would approve. Debates related to normative issues should be settled not within the Constitution but within society, away from the coercive forces of law and politics - or else by amendment.</p><p>M E. Bradford (1934-93) was a professor of English at the University of Dallas.</p><h2>A Woman Soldier&#39;s Own Story</h2><p>For the first time, a complete version of the autobiography of Xie Bingying (1906-2000) provides a fascinating portrayal of a woman fighting to free herself from the constraints of ancient Chinese tradition amid the dramatic changes that shook China during the 1920s, '30s, and '40s.<br><br>Xie's attempts to become educated, her struggles to escape from an arranged marriage, and her success in tricking her way into military school reveal her persevering and unconventional character and hint at the prominence she was later to attain as an important figure in China's political culture. Though she was tortured and imprisoned, she remained committed to her convictions. Her personal struggle to define herself within the larger context of political change in China early in the last century is a poignant testament of determination and a striking story of one woman's journey from Old China into the new world.</p><p>This new translation of the autobiography of Xie Bingying (1906-2000)&#x2015;an important Chinese feminist, pioneering "girl soldier," and skilled writer&#x2015;provides a fascinating portrayal of a woman fighting to free herself from the constraints of ancient Chinese tradition in the context of the dramatic changes that shook China during the 1920s, '30s, and '40s.

Black to write New Key to Weaving, a definitive treatment of the craft and a revision of her previous book, Key to Weaving. Its many new features will be of interest and value to beginners, teachers, and experienced weavers. As an amateur, Miss Black studied weaving as part of an occupational therapy course; later she took an intensive course in Sweden on the theory of advanced weaving. Her book is based on notes gathered during those years. It is designed especially for the beginner, but it is valuable to the teacher as a text for it answers every possible question about the art. Among the new and unique features of this edition are the directions for the Gobelin Tapestry technique. This is perhaps the only book in print which presents detailed instructions and cuts for this and other forms of tapestry weaving. Another noteworthy addition is a chapter devoted exclusively to weaving genuine tartans. The material in New Key to Weaving is arranged according to the various weaves, and the component parts of each weave have been analyzed. The tie-up is explained in its logical relationship to the draft structure. This arrangement is intended to give beginners instruction on a logical basis and, at the same time, to provide an authoritative reference book for the teacher and advanced weaver. The first edition of the book told weavers what to do; this edition tells them not only what to do, but why it is done. An entire chapter is devoted to the theory of weaving, enabling weavers to develop new designs from weaving-book samples or to elaborate on those presented. The tapestry section, the bibliography, and the glossary of weaving terms have been enlarged. A special section lists weaving terms in foreign languages, and 658 accurate and clear original photographs illustrate the text of New Key to Weaving.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>When Lions Roar: The Churchills and the Kennedys</h2><p><b>The&nbsp;first comprehensive history of the deeply entwined personal and public lives of the Churchills and the Kennedys and what their &#x201c;special relationship&#x201d; meant for Great Britain and the United States</b><br>&nbsp;<br><i>When Lions Roar&nbsp;</i>begins in the mid-1930s at Chartwell, Winston Churchill's country estate, with new revelations surrounding a secret business deal orchestrated by Joseph P. Kennedy, the soon-to-be American ambassador to Great Britain and the father of future American president John F. Kennedy. From London to America, these two powerful families shared an ever-widening circle of friends, lovers, and political associates &#x2013; soon shattered by World War II, spying, sexual infidelity, and the tragic deaths of JFK's sister Kathleen and his older brother Joe Jr. &nbsp;By the 1960s and JFK's presidency, the Churchills and the Kennedys had overcome their bitter differences and helped to define the &#x201c;greatness&#x201d; in each other. <br>&nbsp;<br>Acclaimed biographer Thomas Maier tells this dynastic saga through fathers and their sons &#x2013; and the remarkable women in their lives &#x2013; providing keen insight into the Churchill and Kennedy families and the profound forces of duty, loyalty, courage and ambition that shaped them. He explores the seismic impact of Winston Churchill on JFK and American policy, wrestling anew with the legacy of two titans of the twentieth century. Maier also delves deeply into the conflicted bond between Winston and his son, Randolph, and the contrasting example of patriarch Joe Kennedy, a failed politician who successfully channeled his personal ambitions to his children. By approaching these iconic figures from a new perspective, Maier not only illuminates the intricacies of this all-important cross-Atlantic allegiance but also enriches our understanding of the tumultuous time in which they lived and the world events they so greatly influenced.<br>&nbsp;<br>With deeply human portraits of these flawed but larger-than-life figures, <i>When Lions Roar</i> explores the &#x201c;special relationship&#x201d; between the Churchills and Kennedys, and between Great Britain and the United States, highlighting all of its emotional complexity and historic significance.</p><p>THOMAS MAIER is the author of four books, including <i>The Kennedys: America&#x2019;s Emerald Kings</i> and <i>Masters of Sex</i>, the basis&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Showtime series.&#x201c;[Maier] delivers the goods. Weaving the life stories of nearly 30 Churchills and Kennedys into a seamless narrative, Maier smartly anchors his reportage on the clans&#x2019; larger-than-life cornerstones: Winston Churchill and Joseph Kennedy. The sheer accumulation of colorful anecdotes in <i>When Lions Roar</i> makes for riveting reading from start to finish.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i><b>Washington Post</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;A captivating chronicle of the surprisingly many ways that Winston Churchill and Joseph P.

In <b>this fascinating dual biography</b> of Winston Churchill (1874&#x2013;1965) and Joseph Kennedy (1888&#x2013;1969), Maier (<i>The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings</i>) describes not only both men's impact on politics but also the intertwined lives of their families over the course of four decades. Kennedy managed to obtain an appointment as U.S. ambassador to Great Britain in the early 1930s, where he struck up an acquaintance with Churchill, recently excluded from office because of his opposition to India's independence. In subsequent years, the relationship between the two men waxed and waned and eventually broadened to include Churchill's son, Randolph, as well as Kennedy's son Jack. <b>Maier delves into archives on both sides of the Atlantic to bring to his narrative an impressive grasp of the two clans and the rich array of personalities that interacted with them over the decades.

He&#x2019;d spent his whole life as part of the Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club&#x2014;first as the son of its founder, then as a member, and now as vice president of its original charter&#x2014;and he didn&#x2019;t know any other way to live. Even when the club wasn&#x2019;t in the midst of trouble, there was usually some brewing.</p> <p>Not today.</p> <p>Just to have something to do, Jax reeled in his line, checked his bait, and then cast it back into the deep, churning river.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing biting,&#x201d; he said, just to say something.</p> <p>Opie Winston sat six feet away, broad back against a rock formation and a beer in his hand. Shortly after they&#x2019;d come down to the river, Opie had driven a black plastic tube into the soft, damp soil of the riverbank, cast out his line, and slid the handle of his fishing pole into the tube. It wasn&#x2019;t fishing so much as drinking beer and shooting the occasional glance at the line to see if anything might be tugging at it.</p> <p>Jax thought he was begging for the fishing pole to get dragged into the river&#x2014;exactly what would happen if a decent-sized steelhead decided to take the bait&#x2014;but Opie looked too relaxed for him to bring it up. In truth, the arrival of a thieving steelhead didn&#x2019;t seem very likely, considering that there had been two nibbles on Opie&#x2019;s line in nearly three hours and that he had only bothered to reel it in a few times. His focus had been on emptying the cooler of beer they&#x2019;d lugged down from the cabin.</p> <p>Jax rose to fetch a fresh beer, doing his share to help lighten the cooler for the return trip. He propped his fishing rod in the crook of his arm to open the beer and took a long gulp.</p> <p>Opie stretched and rotated his head, and the bones in his neck popped loudly. &#x201c;Either the fish are getting smarter or they can sense how unmotivated we are,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Speak for yourself, Op. I&#x2019;m motivated.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re doing it wrong,&#x201d; Opie said. &#x201c;Fishing&#x2019;s a state of mind, Jax. It&#x2019;s Zen. If you wanted to finish the day with something to eat, we should&#x2019;ve gone hunting like I suggested.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jax settled himself at the base of a massive tree whose thick roots had been exposed by decades of erosion. When the river ran low enough for the ground between the roots to dry out, it made the perfect seat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hunting&#x2019;s too much work,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We came up here to clear our heads.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then why are you bitching about the fish not biting?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jax drained a third of his beer. &#x201c;Things get quiet, I squirm a little. Need to break the silence.&#x201d;</p> <p>He drew back on his fishing pole a bit to see if there was anything dragging on the line, but it moved easily, not even the ghost of a nibble. When he realized Opie hadn&#x2019;t replied, he turned to find his best friend studying him curiously.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Jax asked, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice.</p> <p>&#x201c;How many days do you think you&#x2019;d have to be up here before you could stop worrying about all the other shit?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jax sipped his beer. &#x201c;Not sure I can count that high, brother.&#x201d;</p> <p>They fell quiet again, only the sounds of the river and the rustle of the wind in the trees to disturb the silence. Opie had suggested the trip the day before, and Jax had surprised himself by agreeing. They&#x2019;d thrown beer and bait and a single bag of groceries into the back of Opie&#x2019;s truck and made the drive up to the cabin. The place had been a private retreat for the club since the days of the First Nine, back when Jax&#x2019;s and Opie&#x2019;s fathers and guys like Clay Morrow and Lenny the Pimp had been laying the groundwork for what would become SAMCRO&#x2014;Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original.</p> <p>As kids, Jax and Opie had run wild in the woods around the cabin, fished and swum in the river, and drunk beers they&#x2019;d stolen from their dads. John Teller and Piney Winston had made their sons drink those beers until they threw it all up&#x2014;a biker&#x2019;s lesson. Sitting in the cradle of those old tree roots and watching the river flow by, Jax felt haunted by those days. They hadn&#x2019;t come up to the cabin on anything but business in years, and now he struggled with the weight of his responsibilities to Tara, to his sons, and to the club. Coming up here with Opie had seemed like a good idea, and he&#x2019;d enjoyed just <i>breathing</i> for once, but he could feel hooks set deep in his flesh, dragging him home.</p> <p>He and half the club had survived months in prison and upheaval in their relationships with the Real IRA and the Russian mafia&#x2014;the Bratva. Jax had been shivved in Stockton Penitentiary on orders from the Bratva&#x2019;s chief, Viktor Putlova. SAMCRO had managed to broker a peace with the Russians that lasted long enough for Jax and the other club members who&#x2019;d been sent up with him to get back on the street. SAMCRO had broken that peace at Opie&#x2019;s wedding to Lyla. Putlova and his muscle were all dead, and the Sons had struck a new deal with the Mexicans&#x2014;the Galindo cartel&#x2014;and bought themselves a moment to breathe.</p> <p>Jax and Tara had gotten engaged and announced it to the club. All should&#x2019;ve been right with the world&#x2014;he told himself this trip to the cabin, a sort of mini bachelor party, was proof of that&#x2014;but the engagement had only deepened the fault line that splintered Jax himself in two. There was the man he wanted to be, and then there was the man he&#x2019;d been raised to be. SAMCRO&#x2019;s business had always been illegal guns and now it included drugs, and he&#x2019;d promised Tara he had a plan to get himself&#x2014;and his sons&#x2014;away from the club and the dangers that came along with it.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d promised. And he&#x2019;d meant it.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, promises turned to quicksand.</p> <p>Opie&#x2019;s line twitched, bobbed, and then bent. Jax called his name, put aside his beer, and pushed himself up from the cradling tree roots, but Opie was already in motion. He&#x2019;d seemed to be half-dozing a second before, but now he hurtled toward his fishing pole and grabbed hold just as it began to tilt and slide up out of the tube. Jax dropped his own fishing pole into the tube, thinking he might need to help.</p> <p>&#x201c;Son of a bitch!&#x201d; Opie growled, whipping the pole back to set the hook in the mouth of whatever fish had been dumb enough to take bait that had been sitting in the river for three quarters of an hour.</p> <p>Opie had a few inches and at least thirty pounds on Jax. With his beard and grim eyes, he looked intimidating, like the kind of man who would break a musician&#x2019;s wrists for playing the wrong song&#x2014;which he&#x2019;d actually done.</p> <p>He looked ridiculous reeling in that fish. Jax couldn&#x2019;t help laughing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Guess you met your match,&#x201d; he said, trotting back to fetch his beer. He stood on the riverbank and watched Opie dip the fishing pole toward the water and then jerk it back again, reeling quickly each time he did so.</p> <p>Opie turned to sneer at him, but he couldn&#x2019;t maintain the anger and started laughing instead. He took a step toward Jax and the fishing line snapped, twanging as it ribboned back toward them like a spiderweb in a breeze.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fuck it,&#x201d; Opie said.He hurled the fishing pole into the river, drew his gun, and fired off half a dozen shots in the general direction of the fish. As the echo of gunfire died away, the two of them stood and stared at the fishing pole as it bobbed along for a few seconds longer and then slid below the current.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one way to fish,&#x201d; Jax said with a grin.</p> <p>Opie turned to gaze downriver, brow furrowed.</p> <p>Jax wasn&#x2019;t grinning anymore. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That fishing pole was my old man&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jax glanced at the pole he&#x2019;d brought down from the cabin. They&#x2019;d gotten the rods and reels from a dusty closet. Most of them were rusty, and Jax had chosen the one that seemed the least deteriorated. If one of the fishing poles at the cabin had belonged to his own father, John Teller, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to pick it out from the others. But Piney was alive, and he felt bad about the loss.</p> <p>Half a dozen smart-ass remarks came to mind. Jax gave voice to none of them. Instead, he picked up his own fishing pole and began to reel in the line.</p> <p>Opie gathered up the empty beer bottles and piled them into the cooler. In an alley back in Charming, they might not have bothered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Looks like you needed to get out of Charming more than I did,&#x201d; Jax said. Opie hefted the cooler. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one who just got out of Stockton.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jax put on a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Op. Like you said, I&#x2019;m <i>out</i>. Now I&#x2019;m engaged, and you&#x2019;re a newlywed. The club&#x2019;s put its house in order. Cash is flowing again. Things are good.&#x201d;</p> <p>Opie gave a soft laugh, but without a trace of humor.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what worries me,&#x201d; he said, and started trudging back up through the woods toward the cabin.</p> <p>&#x201c;How does that make sense?&#x201d; Jax asked, falling in step beside him. &#x201c;We in some kind of trouble you&#x2019;re not telling me about?&#x201d;</p> <p>Opie smiled grimly. &#x201c;Trouble&#x2019;s always on the way, Jax. What worries me is times like this. Times when we don&#x2019;t know which direction it&#x2019;s gonna hit us from.&#x201d;</p> <p>His words lingered in Jax&#x2019;s head as the two men reached the cabin and prepared to head back to Charming. It bothered Jax how much Opie&#x2019;s thoughts about trouble seemed to echo his own, like they were swimming in an ocean of it, just waiting for the next big wave.</p> <p>Neither of them could have predicted how soon the next wave of trouble would hit or whom they&#x2019;d find drowning in it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>� 2014 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Bluebush Productions, LLC.</p></p><h2>Dsm 5 Handbook Of Differential Diagnosis Spl Edition (Pb 2017)</h2><p>ISBN 978-9386310774 - DSM-5TM Handbook of Differential Diagnosis - Printed in Asia</p><p></p><h2>The Little Girl Who Fought the Great Depression: Shirley Temple and 1930s America</h2><p><p><strong>How the smile and fortitude of a child actress revived a nation.</strong></p> Her image appeared in periodicals and advertisements roughly twenty times daily; she rivaled FDR and Edward VIII as the most photographed person in the world. Her portrait brightened the homes of countless admirers: from a black laborer&#x2019;s cabin in South Carolina and young Andy Warhol&#x2019;s house in Pittsburgh to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s recreation room in Washington, DC, and gangster &#x201c;Bumpy&#x201d; Johnson&#x2019;s Harlem apartment. A few years later her smile cheered the secret bedchamber of Anne Frank in Amsterdam as young Anne hid from the Nazis. <p>For four consecutive years Shirley Temple was the world&#x2019;s box-office champion, a record never equaled. By early 1935 her mail was reported as four thousand letters a week, and hers was the second-most popular girl&#x2019;s name in the country.</p><p>What distinguished Shirley Temple from every other Hollywood star of the period&#x2015;and everyone since&#x2015;was how brilliantly she shone. Amid the deprivation and despair of the Great Depression, Shirley Temple radiated optimism and plucky good cheer that lifted the spirits of millions and shaped their collective character for generations to come. Distinguished cultural historian John F. Kasson shows how the most famous, adored, imitated, and commodified child in the world astonished movie goers, created a new international culture of celebrity, and revolutionized the role of children as consumers.</p><p>Tap-dancing across racial boundaries with Bill &#x201c;Bojangles&#x201d; Robinson, foiling villains, and mending the hearts and troubles of the deserving, Shirley Temple personified the hopes and dreams of Americans.

His almost unbelievable feat of self-advancement is the toast of his own crew... but the envy of others less blessed than he. After unremitting war a Caribbean posting seems a welcome respite.

Tolkien&#39;s children. Inside would be a letter in strange, spidery handwriting and a beautiful color drawing. The letters told wonderful tales of life at the North Pole: how all the reindeer scattered presents all over the place; how the accident-prone Polar Bear climbed the North Pole and fell through the roof of Father Christmas&#39;s house; how he broke the Moon into four pieces and made the Man in it fall into the back garden; how there were wars with a troublesome horde of goblins. Sometimes the Polar Bear would scrawl a note, adding yet more humor to the stories. No reader, young or old, can fail to be charmed by the inventiveness of Tolkien&#39;s Father Christmas Letters.</p><p>J.R.R. TOLKIEN&nbsp;(1892&#x2013;1973) is the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic and extraordinary works of fiction as <em>The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, </em>and <em>The Silmarillion</em>. His books have been translated into more than fifty languages and have sold many millions of copies worldwide.Don't miss this little gem amidst all the fanfare of Tolkien's novels and Hollywood film. Each year, starting in the early 1920s Tolkien responded to his children's letters to Father Christmas with notes and drawings. He introduces the chores of packing the many packages, the mishaps of weather and the mischief of his faithful helper, North Polar Bear, to his sons and daughter--whose names are added or omitted from the letters as the family grows. Derek Jacobi is fully in the spirit of these epistles, and listeners hear how Tolkien, also, elaborates with one year's letters, and can only send a few lines and a drawing the next. The one missed step is the annoying choice of just one music selection which separates the letters. Nevertheless, make this audio program a holiday tradition.

Since its inception, the justices of the Supreme Court have shaped a nation where children toiled in coal mines, where Americans could be forced into camps because of their race, and where a woman could be sterilized against her will by state law. The Court was the midwife of Jim Crow, the right hand of union busters, and the dead hand of the Confederacy. Nor is the modern Court a vast improvement, with its incursions on voting rights and its willingness to place elections for sale.<br><br>In this powerful indictment of a venerated institution, Ian Millhiser tells the history of the Supreme Court through the eyes of the everyday people who have suffered the most from it. America ratified three constitutional amendments to provide equal rights to freed slaves, but the justices spent thirty years largely dismantling these amendments. Then they spent the next forty years rewriting them into a shield for the wealthy and the powerful. In the Warren era and the few years following it, progressive justices restored the Constitution's promises of equality, free speech, and fair justice for the accused. But, Millhiser contends, that was an historic accident. Indeed, if it weren't for several unpredictable events, Brown v. Board of Education could have gone the other way.<br><br>In <i>Injustices</i>, Millhiser argues that the Supreme Court has seized power for itself that rightfully belongs to the people's elected representatives, and has bent the arc of American history away from justice.</p><p>Ian Millhiser is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and the editor of ThinkProgress Justice. He received his JD from Duke University and clerked for Judge Eric L. Clay of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. His writings have appeared in a diversity of publications, including the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>American Prospect</i>, and the <i>Yale Law &amp; Policy Review</i>. He lives in Arlington, Virginia.<br>They won't be selling <i>Injustices</i> at the Supreme Court gift shop. Ian Millhiser's scathing, exuberant indictment of the many misdeeds of the nation's highest court is a necessary, and highly entertaining, corrective to the mythology that has always surrounded the work of the Justices.&#x201d; <b>Jeffrey Toobin, author of <i>The Oath</i> and <i>The Nine</i></b><br><br> More than just an indictment of the Supreme Court, <i>Injustices</i> offers a stirring defense of the role government plays in bettering people's lives and a heartbreaking window into the lives that are ruined when the justices place their own agenda above the law.&#x201d; <b>Ted Strickland, former Ohio governor and US representative</b><br><br> Attention Howard Zinn fans.

First serial, Men&#39;s Journal.</p><p>At 67, Norman Arnz is well aware of his narrative limitations: "I dare say that no one understands more than the part of the story that is directly contiguous to them." Yet the conjunction of placement and perception is crucial to both him and his tale. The title novella in Jim Harrison's <i>The Beast God Forgot to Invent</i> takes the form of Arnz's written report explaining the death by drowning of a lifetime resident of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Slow, different, backward--Joe Lacort had been labeled all these and more since a car accident illustrated "the Newtonian principle that an object in motion (your head) tends to remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced or unequal force (in Joe's case, a massive gray beech tree)."<p> What Arnz realizes, to his dismay and envy, is that this man "had crossed over a line into an <i>otherness</i> of perception that was unavailable to the rest of us," that his "sense of time has become hopelessly round while ours is linear." Joe's story, told as Arnz circles back and back, questing for original cause, is the story of mapping oneself and one's place in a profoundly captivating--and dislocating--universe. "Maybe," he ponders, "the world really doesn't look like the one I've been seeing all along. That was one of the questions Joe offered." These questions, and answers, are relayed by an astonishing voice: Harrison gives his narrator an oddly intoxicating blend of E.B. White's wry irony and perfectly matter-of-fact precision and Humbert Humbert's solipsistic bravura and edgy suspiciousness. </p><p> And the other two novellas are equally engaging. In "Westward Ho," a Michigan Native American finds himself on a quixotic quest through Los Angeles in pursuit of a stolen bearskin. An assortment of jaded Sancho Panzas aid (I use the term loosely) Brown Dog in his search. Sentimental without being trite, the story soars easily above potential "small-town Indian, big city" limitations. "I Forgot to Go to Spain" returns to a first-person narrator, a glib biographer suspicious that "the language I was using to describe myself to myself might be radically askew."</p><p> Harrison is a rare beast, an author whose ideas are at once grand and simple. His prose is so tantalizingly <i>right</i> that you might be tempted to gather his sentences and fling yourself into their midst, just for the sheer pleasure of it all. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Like his other fiction, Harrison's fourth volume of novellas takes hold of you through the sweetly intoxicating influence and power of his narrative voices, from which strong characterizations flow. As usual, he blends nature with culture, more often than not folding the latter into the former in subtle ways that show us that no matter how hard we try we just can't divorce ourselves from the big picture. The title novella, set in Michigan, takes the form of a written report to a coroner in which a wealthy 67-year-old man--a cultured and savvy narrator who has vacationed in Michigan's Upper Peninsula since childhood--describes events leading to the drowning of his younger friend, Joe. Joe, himself, had been a successful businessman until a car accident and ensuing brain damage had outwardly "enfeebled" him, though in reality turned him more primal. The narrative is far more than a report, as Joe's actions prompt the narrator to examine his own life and his philosophy toward life. In "Westward Ho," a Native American (from Michigan) tracks a double-dealing friend to L.A. to recover his stolen bearskin, which holds sentimental clan value. Brown Dog's adventures in Lotus Land are helped along by characters who are as jaded, eccentric, and cynical as any you're likely to come across this side of Nathanael West. "I Forgot to Go to Spain" is a return to the first-person narrator, which Harrison employs so well. This time the protagonist is a middle-aged writer of knockoff biographies that have made him a lot of money but also sidetracked him from literature--and a trip to an idealized Spain that he had dreamed of since college. It's familiar theme is rescued by a glib narrator unafraid to reveal the contradictions and errors of his thinking, and whose leap into the past (reminiscences and a reunion with an ex-wife) clears a bold path for his future. The novella has reemerged over the past few years, and these tales prove that Jim Harrison is a master of the genre. <i>Frank Caso</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For the first time, Chichikov, Gogol&#39;s trafficker in &#34;souls&#34; (peasants who can be bought, sold, and mortgaged by landowers) is brought to life in an English edition that captures the writer&#39;s virtually comic and lyrical style.</p><p>A socially adept newcomer fluidly inserts himself into an unnamed Russian town, conquering first the drinkers, then the dignitaries. All find him amiable, estimable, agreeable. But what exactly is Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov up to?--something that will soon throw the town "into utter perplexity." <p> After more than a week of entertainment and "passing the time, as they say, very pleasantly," he gets down to business--heading off to call on some landowners. More pleasantries ensue before Chichikov reveals his bizarre plan. He'd like to buy the souls of peasants who have died since the last census. The first landowner looks carefully to see if he's mad, but spots no outward signs. In fact, the scheme is innovative but by no means bonkers. Even though Chichikov will be taxed on the supposed serfs, he will be able to count them as his property and gain the reputation of a gentleman owner. His first victim is happy to give up his souls for free--less tax burden for him. The second, however, knows Chichikov must be up to something, and the third has his servants rough him up. Nonetheless, he prospers. </p><p> <i>Dead Souls</i> is a feverish anatomy of Russian society (the book was first published in 1842) and human wiles. Its author tosses off thousands of sublime epigrams--including, "However stupid a fool's words may be, they are sometimes enough to confound an intelligent man," and is equally adept at yearning satire: "Where is he," Gogol interrupts the action, "who, in the native tongue of our Russian soul, could speak to us this all-powerful word: <i>forward</i>? who, knowing all the forces and qualities, and all the depths of our nature, could, by one magic gesture, point the Russian man towards a lofty life?" Flannery O'Connor, another writer of dark genius, declared Gogol "necessary along with the light." Though he was hardly the first to envision property as theft, his blend of comic, fantastic moralism is <i>sui generis</i>.<i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><i>Nikolai Vasilevich Gogol</i>&nbsp;was born in 1809; his family were small gentry of Ukrainian cossack extraction, and his father was the author of a number of plays based on Ukrainian popular tales. He attended school in N�zhin and gained a reputation for his theatrical abilities. He went to St Petersburg in 1829 and with the help of a friend gained a post in one of the government ministries. Gogol was introduced to Zhukovsky, the romantic poet, and to Pushkin, and with the publication of&nbsp;<i>Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka </i>(1831) he had an entr�e to all the leading literary salons. He even managed for a short period to be Professor of History at the University of St. Petersburg (1834-5).&nbsp;<i>Diary of a Madman</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Story of the Quarrel between Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich</i>&nbsp;appeared in 1934,&nbsp;<i>The Nose</i>&nbsp;in 1836, and&nbsp;<i>The Overcoat&nbsp;</i>in 1842. Gogol also wrote the play&nbsp;<i>The Inspector</i>&nbsp;(1836),&nbsp;<i>Dead Souls</i>&nbsp;(1842), and several moralizing essays defending the Tsarist regime, to the horror of his liberal and radical friends. He lived a great deal abroad, mostly in Rome, and in his last years became increasingly prey to religious mania and despair. He made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1848, but was bitterly disappointed in the lack of feeling that the journey kindled. He returned to Russia and fell under the influence of a spiritual director who told him to destroy his writings as they were sinful. He burned the second part of&nbsp;<i>Dead Souls</i>, and died in 1852 after subjecting himself to a severe regime of fasting.</p><h2>Firestorm</h2><p>In her fourth mystery, park ranger Anna Pigeon and her companions discover a slain firefighter in a Northern California park, sending them on a search for a murderer in the midst of a ravenous winter firestorm. 35,000 first printing. $30,000 ad/promo.

Neither Umblud or Perfidia or the parents appreciate Dillweed's cherished pet, a creature named Skorped. When they threaten Skorped's life and well-being, Dillweed opens his black box and casts the runes, which releases smoky monsters, who do the dirty deeds. And then it's Dillweed turn to go on adventures. <p></p> Filled with nasty characters, beautiful details, and subtle humor, this stylish book follows in the tradition of the deliciously dark work of Edward Gorey, so Dillweed's happy ending undoubtedly means <i>the end</i> for someone else. <br> <br> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with Florence Parry Heide, Author of <i>Dillweed's Revenge</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> You've written more than 100 children&#x2019;s books--that's pretty impressive! How do continue to come up with new and fresh ideas? Where do you find inspiration?</p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> I think ideas are rather like invisible balloons--they're always floating around, and if you are able to reach up and grab one, it's yours, otherwise it will just keep floating around with the other balloons until someone else reaches up and brings it down. Like inventions. Everything--except, of course, things in nature, like trees or clouds--had to be invented by someone. Someone had to be the very first person in the world to think of: the first chair, the first window, the first door. Who was it who reached up and grabbed those balloons? What balloon is up there waiting for you to pull it down?</p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your latest book, <i>Dillweed's Revenge</i>, has quite an interesting back story. Can you tell us a little about how Dillweed came to be? </p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> This book was written forty years ago! At that time The Shrinking of Treehorn had just been published; my brother and his wife were visiting from California, my daughter Roxy joined us, and the four of us decided to write something that weekend for Edward Gorey to illustrate--thus <i>Dillweed's Revenge</i>.</p><p></p> <p>Some editors liked the story but wanted a date on which the art would be finished, and Edward Gorey would never work that way. So, it sat and it sat, with occasional forays out into the world. But now, here it is! Too late for Edward, but Carson Ellis has accomplished wonders with her intricate dazzling illustrations.</p><p></p> <p>And this long road to publication proves that anything is possible, and indeed that is my motto and favorite saying.</p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> Dillweed's story is both humorous and a little bit scary, all at once. Why do you think stories such as these are so appealing to kids?</p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> Of course kids like to be soothed and reassured and coddled and amused, but they also like to read of naughtiness, excitement, and danger.</p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> Do you have any writing rituals or special practices? And what about when you're not writing&#x2014;how do you spend your time? If you had a whole day free with nothing to do, how would you fill it?</p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> I have no rituals or special practices; I just sit down and write. And a whole day free with nothing to do? I can&#x2019;t imagine that. Isn't there always something interesting to do? Yes!</p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was your favorite book when you were a child?</p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> I loved the Oz books and read and re-read every single one. My favorite was Ozma of Oz by L. Frank Baum: what an original and truly imaginative tale! Where is my copy? Did I read it so often I wore it out? Did it turn into dust?</p><p></p> <p>Later, my favorite book was A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, and I read that dozens of times as well and cried each time. It's truly comforting to be crying merrily away while reading a favorite book: you know it's going to turn out happily in the end, so the sadder the book seems, the better.</p><p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> What's the best advice you have for budding authors?</p><p></p> <p><b>A:</b> Advice...oh my! We all have our own reasons to want to write, our own styles, our own approach to writing, and what it is we want to write. What might work for me might never work for anyone else. The thing is: just write. Just proceed. What do you want to write about? If you&#x2019;re telling a story, think about how you want to tell it--what point of view, what language, what style, to what purpose, etc. Do you want to inform your audience, or amuse or challenge them... </p><p></p> <p>To put something into the world that hadn't existed before and would never exist but for you is a thrilling way to spend time! What is this tale that has never been told? Who are these people who have never before existed and will never exist unless you call them into being?

It introduced a new style of hip gangster that revised the stereotype of the <i>Godfather</i> series. It also helped relaunch the career of John Travolta. And it brought Elmore Leonard's impressive body of fiction to larger public attention. In Hollywood, such a triumph usually spawns a sequel--a film that rehashes the great jokes and cool scenes of the first film, but with none of the panache that initially inspired audiences.<p> In the beginning of <i>Be Cool</i>, the sequel to the novel <i>Get Shorty</i>, readers are reminded that Chili Palmer--like his creator--scored a huge success with a gangster film (his was entitled <i>Get Leo</i>). But the sequel, <i>Get Lost</i>, was a predictable dud. Rather than follow that sordid story, however, Leonard takes Chili into a totally new direction. He places Chili on a murder investigation (in which he is a prime suspect) and then traces Chili's entry into the music business. Meanwhile, Leonard reveals a whole new cast of fresh, funny, and flaky characters to populate Chili's world, characters like Elliot the gigantic, gay, Samoan bodyguard who lives to be on the stage. Throughout, the voice of John Travolta rings in Chili's every speech (word has it that Travolta has already been cast to reprise the role) as Leonard pokes fun at the Hollywood apparatus and the task of a sequel writer. </p><p> <i>Be Cool</i> surpasses its original because it is so self-consciously a novel about sequels, about the sometimes cowardice that limits the creativity of the American film industry. It is hard to imagine how Leonard could top the multilayered satire/crime novel/expos�. One only hopes for a sequel. Fans of <i>Be Cool</i> might want to check out music from <i>The Stone Coyotes</i>, the band that served as Leonard's model in the book. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>The sequel to Chili Palmer's hit movie <em>Get Leo</em> tanked and now Chili's itching for a comeback. So when a power lunch with record-label executive and former associate Tommy Athens ends in a mob hit, he soon finds himself in an unlikely alliance with organized-crime detective Darryl Holmes and the likely next target of Russian gangsters. But where others see danger, Chili Palmer sees story possibilities.</p><p>Enter Linda Moon, a singer with aspirations that go further than her current gig in a Spice Girls cover band. Chili takes over as Linda's manager, entering the world of rock stars, pop divas, and hip-hop gangstas. As he wings his way to success in the music business with his trademark cool, Chili manipulates his adversaries and advances his friends, all the while basing the plot of his new film on the action that results. <strong>Be Cool</strong> is rife with drama, jealousy, and betrayal, and all Chili needs to do is survive to make a new box-office hit.</p></p><h2>The Iron Dragon&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>A slave in a dragon factory that manufactures flying fighting machines, Jane changes her destiny when a voice from a dragon promising freedom and revenge prompts her to escape and challenge the foundations of the world.</p><p><p>Michael Swanwick is the author of a novella, two short story collections, and four critically acclaimed novels: <i>Vacuum Flowers;</i> the Nebula Award-winning <i>Stations of the Tide; The Iron Dragon's Daughter,</i> which was named a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year and nominated for a World Fantasy Award; and <i>Jack Faust,</i> also a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book. Mr. Swanwick lives with his wife and son in Philadelphia, PA.</p>Seething, brain-bursting, all but indescribable upper-world coming-of-age yarn, from the author of a string of splendid novels (Stations of the Tide; Griffin's Egg, etc.). A world where magic and technology both work exists at a much higher energy level than our own. Here dwell kobolds, imps, elves, demons, dwarves, and other fantastical beings--including Powers who poach souls from our world to use as slaves in the upper world. One such wretched waif, Jane Alderberry, is forced to toil in a vast, terrifying factory that manufactures stealth-attack dragons using both magical and technological components. One particularly evil dragon, pretending to be an inert wreck, desperately wants to escape the factory but cannot fly without a pilot. He arranges for Jane to discover him; but, before agreeing to help, Jane requires the dragon to reveal his true name and thus yield Jane a measure of power over him. Together, then, Jane and Melanchthon escape. Jane, beginning to grow up, attends a supernatural version of high school, then studies alchemy at college; her boyfriend, whom she can never quite bring herself to trust, is a serial incarnation, forever giving his life to save hers. Eventually, Jane comes to the attention of the Powers, and, following the Teind--a dreadful, goddess-inspired winnowing-out of the world's inhabitants--falls into despair, just as Melanchthon announces that he intends to assault the goddess's Spiral Castle, a puzzle-palace located in a set of yet higher dimensions. At once a gleefully bizarre parody and a dazzlingly imaginative tour de force, flawed by the rather distant, uninvolving narrative and an ending equivalent to ``then she fell out of bed and woke up.''

She is also the author of the Molly Murphy Mysteries set in turn-of-the-century New York, and the Constable Evans Mysteries set in Wales. She was born in England and lives in Northern California.Set in 1932, Bowen's winning third Royal Spyness whodunit to feature Lady Georgiana, a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and 34th in line to the English throne (after 2008's <i>A Royal Pain</i>), will please fans of romantic, humorous historicals. Georgie makes an ill-advised attempt to start her own business, before discovering, to her embarrassment, that her definition of a female escort is not the same as that of her clientele. Fearing scandal, the authorities send her off to the family castle in Scotland, where a shooting party that includes the prince of Wales is in residence, with a brief from the Home Office to keep her eyes peeled for threats to the Crown. A series of serious accidents suggests that someone is targeting members of the royal family. The violence soon escalates to murder. The secret behind the attacks has been employed by such other mystery writers as David Dickinson and Robin Paige, but Bowen, who's won both Agatha and Anthony awards, puts a fresh slant on it. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Greenoff, British author and founder of the Cross Stitch Guild, not only simplifies this needlecraft but also expands readers' horizons well beyond the traditional "x marks the spot." Each chapter, from getting started to finishing techniques, is filled with incredible detail. Her "stitch perfect" sidebars, for example, feature great advice from the perspective of an experienced stitcher, such as "count threads, not holes" or, when using metallic thread, use the stab method--two strokes for in and out, rather than the smoother one step of hand sewing. A 39-stitch and 59-motif library will give sewers a wide spread of available projects, whether a single-object Victorian posy or complex winter sampler. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Margot and Rudolf Wittkower explore the history of the familiar idea that artistic inspiration is a form of madness, a madness directly expressed in artists� unhappy and eccentric lives. This idea of the alienated artist, the Wittkowers demonstrate, comes into its own in the Renaissance, as part of the new bid by visual artists to distinguish themselves from craftsmen, with whom they were then lumped together. Where the skilled artisan had worked under the sign of light-fingered Mercury, the ambitious artist identified himself with the mysterious and brooding Saturn. Alienation, in effect, was a rung by which artists sought to climb the social ladder.<br><br>As to the reputed madness of artists� well, some have been as mad as hatters, some as tough-minded as the shrewdest businessmen, and many others wildly and willfully eccentric but hardly crazy. What is certain is that no book presents such a splendid compendium of information about artists� lives, from the early Renaissance to the beginning of the Romantic era, as <i>Born Under Satur</i>n. The Wittkowers have read everything and have countless anecdotes to relate: about artists famous and infamous; about suicide, celibacy, wantonness, weird hobbies, and whatnot. These make <i>Born Under Saturn</i> a comprehensive, quirky, and endlessly diverting resource for students of history and lovers of the arts.<br><i>� This book is fascinating to read because of the abundant quotations which bring to life so many remarkable </i><br><i> individuals.� � </i>The New York Review of Books</p><p><b>RUDOLF WITTKOWER</b> (1901-1971) was a German-American art historian. He was on the staff of the Warburg Institute, London, and became professor at the University of London. He then headed the Department of Fine Arts and Archaeology at Columbia. His highly original works in English include <i>Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism</i>, <i>Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600&#x2014;1750, </i> <i>Essays in the History of Architecture</i>, <i>Essays in the History of Art</i>, and <i>Baroque Art: The Jesuit Contribution</i>. <br><br><b>MARGOT WITTKOWER </b>(1902-1995)<b> </b>was born in Berlin and established herself as an interior designer.

You wear a certain jacket because you liked the way it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.<br> <br>Without our realizing it, other people&#x2019;s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous occasion. Even strangers have a startling impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we&#x2019;re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same in both cases).<br> <br>But social influence doesn&#x2019;t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we conform, or imitate others around us. But in other cases we diverge, or <i>avoid</i> particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don&#x2019;t want to look like a soccer mom.<br> <br>In his surprising and compelling <i>Invisible Influence</i>, Jonah Berger integrates research and thinking from business, psychology, and social science to focus on the subtle, invisible influences behind our choices as individuals. By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it&#x2014;and how we can use this knowledge to make better-informed decisions and exercise more control over our own behavior.</p><p>Jonah Berger&nbsp;is a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and is the internationally bestselling author of <i>Contagious</i> and<i> Invisible Influence</i>.

Monkey See, Monkey Do<p></p> <br>What could be easier than matching the length of two lines?<br> <br>Imagine you were asked to participate in a basic vision test. In front of you is a pair of cards. On the left card is a line. And on the right card are three comparison lines, A, B, and C.<br> <br>Your job is simple. Just pick the line on the right that is the same length as the target line on the left card. Decide whether line A, line B, or line C is the same length as the target line. Should be easy, right?<br> <br><br> <br>Now let&#x2019;s add one more wrinkle. Rather than doing the experiment alone, you participate with a group of your peers.<br> <br>You show up at a nondescript building on a university campus, and walk up a flight of stairs to room B7. You see that six other people are already seated around three sides of a square table, so you grab the last remaining chair, the second from the end.<br> <br>The experimenter gives the instructions. He reiterates that your job is to pick the line on the right that is most similar in length to the one on the left. The group will do a number of trials just like the one above. As the group is small, and the number of trials relatively few, he&#x2019;ll call on each person in turn to announce their choice, which he&#x2019;ll record on a special form.<br> <br>The experimenter points to the person on the left side of the table and asks him to start. This first participant has red hair, is wearing a grey collared shirt, and seems to be around twenty-five years old. He looks at the same lines you saw on the last page and, without missing a beat, reports his judgment: &#x201c;Line B,&#x201d; he says. The next participant seems a little older, maybe around twenty-seven, and is dressed more casually. But he reports the same answer. &#x201c;B,&#x201d; he says. The third person also says B, as does the fourth, and the fifth, and then it gets to you.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your answer?&#x201d; asks the experimenter. Which line would you pick?<br> <br>When psychologist Solomon Asch designed this line length study in 1951, he was testing more than people&#x2019;s vision. He was hoping to prove someone wrong.<br> <br>A few years earlier another psychologist, Muzafer Sherif, had conducted a similar study and found surprising results.1 Sherif was interested in how norms form&#x2014;how groups of people come to agree on common ways of seeing the world.<br> <br>To study this question, he put people in an unusual situation. In a dark room, Sherif displayed a small pinpoint of light on the wall. He asked people to stare at the light and not move their eyes for as long as possible. Then he asked them to report how far the point of light moved.<br> <br>The point of light was immobile. It didn&#x2019;t move at all.<br> <br>But for individuals in the room, the light seemed to shift ever so slightly. Gazing at a small dot of light in an otherwise dark room is tougher than it sounds. After staring in the darkness for a while, our eyes fatigue and move involuntarily. This tendency causes the point of light to seem as though it moves even though it doesn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Sherif studied this phenomenon, called the autokinetic effect, because he wanted to see how people might rely on others when they were uncertain.<br> <br>First he put people in the room alone, by themselves. Each person picked a number based on how far they thought the light moved. Some people thought two inches, others thought six inches. Different people&#x2019;s estimates varied widely.<br> <br>Then, Sherif put those same people into groups.<br> <br>Rather than making their guesses alone, two or three participants would be in the room at the same time, each making estimates that the others could hear.<br> <br>People didn&#x2019;t have to agree; they could guess whatever they wanted. But when placed together, what was once a discordant mix of differing views soon became a symphony of similarity. In the presence of their peers, the guesses converged. One participant might have said two inches when she was by herself, while another might have said six inches. But when placed together they soon came to a common estimate. The person who said two inches increased her estimate (to something like three and a half inches) and the person who said six inches decreased his estimate (to something like four inches).<br> <br>People&#x2019;s estimates conformed to those around them.<br> <br>This conformity happened even though people were unaware it occurred. When Sherif asked participants whether they were influenced by the judgments of others, most people said no.<br> <br>And social influence was so strong that it persisted even when people went back to making judgments by themselves. After the group trials, Sherif split people up and had them return to making guesses alone. But people continued to give the answers that they had settled on with the group, even after the group was gone. People who had increased their estimates when others were in the room (from two to four inches, for instance) tended to keep guessing that larger number even when they were by themselves.<br> <br>The group&#x2019;s influence stuck.<br> <br>Sherif&#x2019;s findings were controversial. Do people just do whatever others are doing? Are we mindless automatons who simply follow others&#x2019; every action? Notions of independence and free thought seemed at stake.<br> <br>But Solomon Asch wasn&#x2019;t convinced.<br> <br>Asch thought conformity was simply a result of the situation Sherif used. Guessing how far a point of light moved wasn&#x2019;t like asking people whether they like Coke or Pepsi or whether they want butter or cream cheese on their bagel. It was a judgment most people had never made, or even thought of making. Further, the right answer was far from obvious. It wasn&#x2019;t an easy question. It was a hard one.<br> <br>In sum, the situation was ripe with uncertainty. And when people feel uncertain, relying on others makes sense. Others&#x2019; opinions provide information. And particularly when people feel unsure, why not take that information into account? When we don&#x2019;t know what to do, listening to others&#x2019; opinions, and shifting ours based on them, is a reasonable thing to do.<br> <br>To test whether people conformed because the answer was uncertain, Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when the answer was obvious. When people could easily tell the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others.<br> <br>The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else.<br> <br>Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity would be reduced. Drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group&#x2019;s responses.<br> <br>There was always one real participant, but Asch filled the rest of the room with actors. Each actor gave predetermined responses. Sometimes they gave the right answer, picking the line on the right that was the same as the one on the left. But on other preselected trials, all of them gave the same wrong answer, saying &#x201c;Line B,&#x201d; for example, when the answer was clearly line C.<br> <br>Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn&#x2019;t matter that others gave the wrong response. People should act independently and go with what they saw. Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Not even close.<br> <br>Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn&#x2019;t conform on every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.<br> <br>Even though people&#x2019;s own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.<br> <br>Solomon Asch was wrong and Sherif was right. Even when the answer is clear, people still imitate others.2<br> THE POWER OF CONFORMITY<p></p> <br>Imagine a hot day. Really hot. So sweltering that the birds won&#x2019;t even sing. You&#x2019;re parched, so you drop into a local fast-food restaurant to grab a cold drink. You walk up to the counter and the clerk asks what you&#x2019;d like.<br> <br>What generic term would you use if you wanted a sweetened carbonated beverage? What would you say to the clerk? If you had to fill in the blank &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a ____________, please,&#x201d; how would you do it?<br> <br>People&#x2019;s answers depend a lot on where they grew up. New Yorkers, Philadelphians, or people from the northeastern United States would ask for a &#x201c;soda.&#x201d; But Minnesotans, Midwesterners, people who grew up in the Great Plains region of the country would probably ask for a &#x201c;pop.&#x201d; And people from Atlanta, New Orleans, and much of the South would ask for a &#x201c;Coke.&#x201d; Even if they wanted a Sprite.<br> <br>(For fun, try ordering a Coke next time you&#x2019;re in the South. The clerk will ask you what kind, and then you can tell them a Sprite, Dr Pepper, root beer, or even a regular Coke.)I<br> <br>Where we grow up, and the norms and practices of people around us, shape everything from the language we use to the behaviors we engage in. Kids adopt their parents&#x2019; religious beliefs and college students adopt their roommates&#x2019; study habits. Whether making simple decisions, like which brand to buy, or more consequential ones, like which career path to pursue, we tend to do as others around us do.<br> <br>The tendency to imitate is so fundamental that even animals do it.<br> <br>Vervets are small, cute monkeys found mostly in South Africa. Similar in size to a small dog, they have light-grey bodies, black faces, and a fringe of white around their stomachs. The monkeys live in groups of ten to seventy individuals, with males striking out on their own and changing groups once they reach sexual maturity.<br> <br>Scientists often study vervets because of their humanlike characteristics. The monkeys display hypertension, anxiety, and even social and abusive alcohol consumption. Like humans, most prefer drinking in the afternoon, rather than morning, but heavy drinkers will drink even in the morning and some will even drink until they pass out.<br> <br>In one clever study, researchers conditioned wild vervets to avoid certain foods.3 Scientists gave the monkeys two trays of corn, one containing pink corn and the other blue corn. For one group of monkeys, the scientists soaked the pink corn in a bitter, repulsive liquid. For another group of monkeys, the researchers flipped the colors&#x2014;blue tasted bad and pink normal.<br> <br>Gradually, the monkeys learned to avoid whichever color tasted bad. The first group of monkeys avoided the pink corn while the other group avoided the blue. Just like soda in the Northeast and pop in the Midwest, local norms had been created.<br> <br>But the scientists weren&#x2019;t just trying to condition the monkeys, they were interested in social influence. What would happen to new, untrained monkeys who joined each group?<br> <br>To see what would happen, the researchers took the colored corn away and waited a few months until new baby monkeys were born. Then, they placed trays of pink and blue corn in front of the monkeys. Except this time they removed the bad taste. Now the pink corn and the blue corn both tasted fine.<br> <br>Which would the baby monkeys choose?<br> <br>Pink and blue corn were just as tasty, so the baby monkeys should have gone after both. But they didn&#x2019;t. Even though the infants weren&#x2019;t around when one color of corn tasted bitter, they imitated the other members of their group. If their mothers avoided the blue corn, they did the same. Some babies even sat on the avoided color to eat the other, ignoring it as potential food.<br> <br>Conformity was so strong that monkeys who switched groups also switched colors. Some older male monkeys happened to change groups during the study. Some moved from the Pink Avoiders to the Blue Avoiders, and vice versa. And as a result, these monkeys also changed their food preferences. Switchers adopted the local norm, eating whichever color was customary among their new group.<br> <br>We might have grown up calling carbonated fizzy beverages &#x201c;soda,&#x201d; but move to a different region of the country and our language starts to shift. A couple years surrounded by people calling it &#x201c;Coke&#x201d; and we might find ourselves doing the same. Monkey see, monkey do.<br> WHY PEOPLE CONFORM<p></p> <br>A few years ago, I flew to San Francisco for a consulting project. If you&#x2019;ve been to the Bay Area, you know that on any given day the climate can be quite variable. Summers tend not to be that hot and winters don&#x2019;t get terribly cold. But on any particular day, it&#x2019;s hard to know what you&#x2019;re going to get. San Francisco can easily be 70 degrees in November and 50 degrees in July. Indeed, a famous quote about the city&#x2014;commonly (but erroneously) attributed to Mark Twain&#x2014;is that &#x201c;the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.&#x201d;<br> <br>My trip happened to take place in November. Since I was traveling from the East Coast, I&#x2019;d brought my heavy winter coat. But as I got ready to go out that first morning in San Francisco, I faced a dilemma: Should I wear my coat or not? I checked the weather report, which suggested the temperature would be somewhere in the high 50s to low 60s, but I still wasn&#x2019;t sure. That sounded right on the margin between warm and cold. How to decide?<br> <br>Rather than just guessing myself, I used a time-tested trick: I looked out the window to see what other people were wearing.<br> <br>When we&#x2019;re not sure about the right thing to do, we look to others to help us figure it out. Imagine looking for a parking spot. After driving around for what seems like forever, you find a whole side of a street free of cars. Success! But excitement quickly turns to concern: If no one else parked here, maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t, either. There might be street cleaning or some special event that makes parking there illegal.<br> <br>If there are even a couple other cars parked on the street, though, the concern disappears. You feel more confident you&#x2019;ve found a legitimate spot.<br> <br>Trying to sort out which dog food to buy or which preschool to send your child to? Knowing what others have done provides insight into what might be best for you. Talking to other dog owners who have similar breeds will help you figure out the right food option for your dog&#x2019;s size and energy level. Talking to other parents will help you figure out which schools have a good student-teacher ratio and provide the right mix of learning and play.<br> <br>Just as people relied on others to help them figure out how much the light moved in the dark room, we often rely on others to provide a useful source of information that helps us make better decisions.<br> <br>Using others as information sources saves us time and effort. Rather than giving Fido a new brand of food every week, or spending days reading up on the minutiae of all the preschools in the area, others provide a useful shortcut. A heuristic that simplifies decision making. If other people do it, choose it, or like it, it must be good.<br> <br>But as the experiment about the length of lines demonstrates, imitation is about more than just information. Even when we know the answer, others&#x2019; behavior can still have an impact. And the reason is social pressure.<br> <br>Think about going out to dinner at a nice restaurant with a group of colleagues from work. Business has been great recently, so the boss takes everyone out to celebrate. Some New American place that puts nouveau touches on old favorites.

Their other thiry-five novels include the bestselling series the <i>Zion Chronicles</i> and the <i>Zion Covenant</i>. Together they have won eight Evangelical Christian Publishers Gold Medallion awards.This is the fifth installment in the best-selling Thoenes' Zion Legacy series about the founding of modern Jerusalem, but in <i>The Jerusalem Scrolls</i> [BKL Ag 01], the fourth entry, they jumped back 2,000 years to tell their version of the ministry of Jesus. They continue that "flashback" here with the story of Miryam, who experienced the worst sort of misery before coming under the influence of Yeshua. Now she prospers in the faith, founding a home for the poor and abandoned--particularly unwed mothers. Marcus Longinus, the Roman centurion and Miryam's old lover, slowly turns to conversion, in the process rediscovering Miryam as a radiant Christian. Marcus becomes the Good Samaritan of Yeshua's parable, saving the Sanhedrin Nakdimon (Nicodemus) from the bandit and would-be revolutionary bar Abbas (Barabbas), in a merging of biblical stories with the necessities of plot. Both Marcus and Nakdimon seek out Yeshua to bring reports back to Pilate and the Sanhedrin, respectively; others, like three woebegone children, seek him out in order to be healed. Yeshua appears in the last third of the novel, a stirring presence not entirely bound to verses in the Gospels. As the narrative ends, revolution is brewing, pointing to at least one more novel to conclude this historical aside. In fact, the trilogy within the series, if that's what it turns out to be, is a more compelling narrative than the framing story that encloses it. <i>John Mort</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was a small Nepali-made notebook&#x2014;the brand name was Happy Days! or some such thing&#x2014; and it made me smile every time I looked at it. I took it everywhere I went, and wrote in it often.</p> <p>The children constantly asked me what I was writing, and I would tell them I was recording our conversations. That was true, but it was more than that. I was also recording everything I found strange in my new home. Like the fact that the kids chewed on chicken bones until they were practically dust, or that one of the boys, Santosh, had a digital watch which he&#x2019;d borrowed from a friend that, along with displaying the hour, flashed &#x201c;I Love You!&#x201d; once per second.</p> <p>There were times I was caught without my notebook, like in the middle of a soccer game when Dawa&#x2019;s shot&#x2014;destined for just inside the invisible right post&#x2014;was blocked by the broadside of a cow, and I had to try to recall from memory the captivating debate over the role of livestock in team sports, and whether or not the goal should count. (It didn&#x2019;t.)</p> <p>Then, when the children would go to bed at 8 p.m., I would bundle up in two or three fleeces, a hat, and woolen gloves I had cut the fingers out of; I&#x2019;d pull out my notebook and I&#x2019;d sit down to write my travel blog, copying everything I had put into the notebook over the course of the day into an old, ultra-light Dell I&#x2019;d bought off eBay for about 200 dollars. It was pretty much useless except as a word processor, but it was the most precious thing I owned. Over the next three years, traveling the globe and living in Nepal, I would end up typing just over half-a-million words on that little workhorse&#x2014;five times the length of <em>Little Princes</em>.</p> <p>It turned out that writing everything down in the moment was critical because the more time I spent in Nepal, the more normal these &#x201c;strange&#x201d; things became. It became normal to watch my blankets being made from scratch on the ground outside my house, to trade broken flip-flops for potatoes, and to use outhouses on a daily basis without thinking twice about it. (Did you hear that, people? <em>Outhouses</em>!)</p> <p>The funny thing is, with all that note-taking, I never had any intention of writing a book about my time in Nepal. It honestly never occurred to me that it was a much of a story until someone else mentioned the idea to me.</p> <p>Once I started writing the book, however, I couldn&#x2019;t stop. I went back to my old notebooks and I was suddenly in Nepal again, hearing in my mind exactly how Hriteek had laughed, or Nishal had protested, or Raju had squealed as he&#x2019;d run through the house, bare feet padding against the cold cement floors.</p> <p><em>Little Princes</em>, the book, allowed me to revisit that wonderful, difficult, challenging, happy time of my life. I still get back to Nepal, of course, and I still see the children. But they change, they grow up. Writing <em>Little Princes</em> allowed me to visit the children as they were. And also, as the person I was.</p><blockquote><p>One Person Can Make a Difference</p></blockquote><p>In search of adventure, twenty-nine-year-old Conor Grennan traded his day job for a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month stint volunteering at the Little Princes Children&#x2019;s Home, an orphanage in war-torn Nepal. </p><p>Conor was initially reluctant to volunteer, unsure whether he had the proper skill, or enough passion, to get involved in a developing country in the middle of a civil war. But he was soon overcome by the herd of rambunctious, resilient children who would challenge and reward him in a way that he had never imagined. When Conor learned the unthinkable truth about their situation, he was stunned: The children were not orphans at all. Child traffickers were promising families in remote villages to protect their children from the civil war&#x2014;for a huge fee&#x2014;by taking them to safety. They would then abandon the children far from home, in the chaos of Nepal&#x2019;s capital, Kathmandu.</p><p>For Conor, what began as a footloose adventure becomes a commitment to reunite the children he had grown to love with their families, but this would be no small task. He would risk his life on a journey through the legendary mountains of Nepal, facing the dangers of a bloody civil war and a debilitating injury. Waiting for Conor back in Kathmandu, and hopeful he would make it out before being trapped in by snow, was the woman who would eventually become his wife and share his life&#x2019;s work. </p><p><em>Little Princes</em> is a true story of families and children, and what one person is capable of when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. At turns tragic, joyful, and hilarious, <em>Little Princes</em> is a testament to the power of faith and the ability of love to carry us beyond our wildest expectations.</p></p><h2>Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</h2><p>1st Triad Panther 1978 edition paperback vg++ book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>&#x201c;A psychedelic odyssey of hallucinations-within-hallucinations from which no reader emerges unscathed.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>On Mars, the harsh climate could make any colonist turn to drugs to escape a dead-end existence. Especially when the drug is Can-D, which translates its users into the idyllic world of a Barbie-esque character named Perky Pat. When the mysterious Palmer Eldritch arrives with a new drug called Chew-Z, he offers a more addictive experience, one that might bring the user closer to God. But in a world where everyone is tripping, no promises can be taken at face value. &nbsp; This Nebula Award nominee is one of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s enduring classics, at once a deep character study, a dark mystery, and a tightrope walk along the edge of reality and illusion.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>.<br><br>In this wildly disorienting funhouse of a novel, populated by God-like--or perhaps Satanic--takeover artists and corporate psychics, Philip K. Dick explores mysteries that were once the property of St. Paul and Aquinas. His wit, compassion, and knife-edged irony make <b>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</b> moving as well as genuinely visionary.</p><h2>Agent Of Destiny: The Life And Times Of General Winfield Scott</h2><p>The son of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and an accomplished historian presents the first biography of General Winfield Scott, who played a key role in shaping America&#39;s borders in the wars of the nineteenth century, as well as America&#39;s military. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>It's about time somebody wrote a biography of Winfield Scott, and reading this fascinating account by accomplished military historian John S. D. Eisenhower, you'll wonder why nobody did it sooner. Scott's career spanned an astonishing 54 years and he spent most of it as a general. He was one of the few American heroes to emerge from the War of 1812; he launched a daring and successful invasion of Mexico in 1847; and he defended a vulnerable Washington, D.C., during the first months of the Lincoln administration in 1861. Scott was a profoundly courageous man with a flair for the organizational side of military life. Yet an unseemly amount of ambition and vanity marred his character, even as these qualities help make him an interesting subject for Eisenhower (who is, you guessed it, the son of Ike). <i> Agent of Destiny</i> is a skilled portrait of a man who is often overshadowed by the generation of Civil War leaders following him. Eisenhower deserves our thanks for writing this magnificent book about a vital figure.<p><b>John S. D. Eisenhower</b> (1922-2013) was the son of Dwight D. Eisenhower, a former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium and the author of <i>Yanks: The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I.</i></p></p><h2>Heart Of Darkness &amp; The Secret Sharer</h2><p>Very good condition; no writing or markings inside.

Alexandra Richie's thousand page tome spans from the time of Nero to Helmut Kohl. It is an encyclopedic description of the <i>Schicksal Stadt Deutschlands</i>--the City of German Destiny--filled with the politics of rulers and the ideology of artists. <p> Richie doesn't romanticize Berlin; early on, she invokes Goethe's view of the city as bourgeois, brash, and onerous. "Like the metropolis in <i>Faust</i> it has always been a rather shabby place," Richie comments. "It is neither an ancient gem like Rome, nor an exquisite beauty like Prague, nor a geographical marvel like Rio. It was formed not by the gentle, cultured hand which made Dresden or Venice but was wrenched from the unpromising landscape by sheer hard work and determination." By placing her historical account in a world-encompassing perspective, the culture described in <i>Faust's Metropolis</i> comments on the whole of Germany and its people. </p><p> The author is most eloquent in describing the recent history of the city. As a resident during its divided years, she describes Berlin as the ultimate "border city," on the frontline of the dueling <i>Weltanschauungs</i> of the Cold War. Her tone is familiar in describing the changing face of the city, and her enthusiasm evident as the book moves into the modern era. Filled with the insights of its unique and myriad residents, <i>Faust's Metropolis</i> recounts Berlin's culture, providing the reader with a thorough history and authoritative analysis.</p>Alexandra Richie wrote this book while a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. She has lived and worked in both East and West Berlin and in the unified capital, and wrote her Oxford doctorate on the history of the city. Her family has been linked to Berlin since the fourteenth century. She is currently researching and writing on German-Russian history. This is her first book.</p><h2>Flyfisher&#39;s Guide to Idaho (2nd Edition) (Flyfisher&#39;s Guides)</h2><p>Authors Ken Retallic and Rocky Barker, native Idahoans cover all of the great fishing waters in Idaho.

They find it in abundance at Napa Valley's celebrated Tra Vigne restaurant (the name is Italian for "among the vines"), where an enchanting vineyard setting and chef Michael Chiarello's robust Italian dishes make for an unforgettable dining experience. Now, Chiarello takes readers behind the scenes at the restaurant, sharing recipes and reminiscences inspired by his years at Tra Vigne and the good Italian cooking of his family. <i>The Tra Vigne Cookbook</i> celebrates the natural beauty and abundance of the Napa Valley with a passionate gastronomic journey through the changing seasons. In addition to seasonal delights like roasted asparagus, lemon-braised artichokes, and pumpkin polenta, home cooks will discover the secrets for Tra Vigne classics such as herb gnocchi with braised lamb shanks and wild mushrooms, crunchy fritto misto with tomato vinegar, rich and crumbly Italian holiday cookies, and a decadent chocolate tiramis�. With lush photographs and a strikingly contemporary design, <i>The Tra Vigne Cookbook</i> is a must-have cookbook this fall.<p>Visit <b>seasonbyseason.com</b>!</p></p><p>"The closer your cooking stays to the seasons, the simpler--and better--your cooking will be." Michael Chiarello's mom told him that as he stood beside her at the stove, learning what a real Italian tomato sauce looks, smells, and sounds like as it cooks. Those lessons led him into the chef's life and his own restaurant in the heart of California's wine country, Tra Vigne. So it should come as no surprise that the subtitle of his lush cookbook, <i>The Tra Vigne Cookbook</i> is <i>Seasons in the California Wine Country</i>. And such is the organizing principle. Not only are the sections of the book divided into the four seasons, but the subsets include four ingredients key to each season: asparagus or garlic in spring, for example, or mushrooms and eggplant in fall.<p> Chiarello describes his own cooking style as "combining spectacular ingredients, professional technique, and imaginative presentations." He shows how to take this into your own home kitchen, in word and technique. A lot of the exceptional flavors he is able to muster come from the flavor enhancers he has put up in his pantry through the seasons--the flavored olives, the dried figs. To read his section on the pantry is to yearn for a dark, cool basement. "Take the time when you have it in order to reap the rewards later when you don't," Chiarello encourages.</p><p> <i>The Tra Vigne Cookbook</i> is a carefully layered dish of family reminiscence, tech tips, master recipes, and heartfelt yearnings for the seasons and the way they pass outside the windows of a country restaurant, the way they feel on the skin, the way they taste and smell. It's about attitude. Chiarello grabs it all and makes it accessible. <i>The Tra Vigne Cookbook</i> is a large-format, elegant book you will want to leave open on the table to flip through. Let your attention get caught up in it and carried away. Chiarello stays with the seasons, and his accomplishment is simpler and better as a result. And therein lies a world of glorious, flavorful complexity. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Michael Chiarello -- chef and owner of the acclaimed Tra Vigne restaurant in the Napa Valley -- is the creator of Consorzio, a popular line of flavored oils and vinegars.<br><br>Penelope Wisner is the co-author, with Michael Chiarello of Chronicle's Flavored Oils (over 40,000 copies sold).<br><br>Karl Petzke is the co-author, with Sara Slavin, of the award-winning book Espresso and is the photographer for Pears (both from Chronicle Books).</p><h2>United States History Student Activities 4th Edition</h2><p>The U.S. History Student Activities Manual (4th ed.) provides activities for reinforcement, enrichment, and review to help the student understand and apply lessons from the ST, including experience analyzing primary documents of U.S. History.

The dynamics of warfare in the present age still remain comprehensible to us through careful study of the past.

Now, in <i>The Senator Next Door</i>, she chronicles her remarkable heartland journey, from her immigrant grandparents to her middle-class suburban upbringing to her rise in American politics.</p><p>After being kicked out of the hospital while her infant daughter was still in intensive care, Klobuchar became the lead advocate for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay. Later she ran Minnesota's biggest prosecutor's office and in 2006 was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from her state. Along the way she fashioned her own political philosophy grounded in her belief that partisan flame-throwing takes no courage at all; what really matters is forging alliances with unlikely partners to solve the nation's problems.</p><p>Optimistic, plainspoken and often very funny, <i>The Senator Next Door </i>is a story about how the girl next door decided to enter the fray and make a difference.

Is the church in better shape than the American culture? Sadly, the church today is in worse condition with an average of 76% of church members and pastors in the overweight to obese category. And in a review of obesity in world religions, evangelicals are dramatically heavier than any other world religion.

A tragic accusation for a group that is called to represent Jesus Christ to the world. God provided the proper fuel for our bodies when he created every green plan, seed bearing plant, and fruit on Day 3 of creation.

However, the alterations are so minor that they are virtually unnoticeable. Only the final page, Faith in the Future, has been entirely rewritten&#x2013;but the earlier material is still perfectly valid. And, unfortunately, the new edition is inconsistent in updating statistics. The membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is still given as about five million worldwide when it is well over 12 million. Figures in the sections on Hinduism and Jainism contradict other areas of the book; Sikhism quotes numbers from 1993, and Islam uses a 1996 calendar. Such sloppiness detracts from the books usefulness and questions its necessity. <i>Religions</i> is a valuable resource, covering the beliefs and practices of 10 major religions and lavishly illustrated with color photos, maps, diagrams, and charts; but libraries owning the earlier edition need not replace it.<i>&#x2013;Ann W.

This is a classic murder mystery set in the outskirts of Essex. The victim is the wealthy mistress of Styles Court. The list of suspects is long and includes her gold-digging new spouse and stepsons, her doctor, and her hired companion.</p><p>Here is the famous first case that launched the legendary career of Hercule Poirot and his ingenious creator Agatha Christie, now the most popular mystery writer of all time, as well as the world's best-selling author (over two billion copies of her books are in print). With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>The Carousel: A Novel</h2><p>The author of The Christmas Box and The Looking Glass returns to the moving but unfinished saga of Faye Murrow and Michael Keddington.</p><p>Michael Keddington and Faye Murrow are young lovers who marry on the eve of Faye's departure for medical school. While the bonds of matrimony and faith pull them together, the troubles of the real world do sunder: disapproving parents, work demands, distance, death, and an unplanned pregnancy. As in his earlier novel, <i>The Christmas Box</i>, nostalgia and emotion run unchecked, to the delight of most readers.<p> This is not the great American novel, but Evans never pretends that it is, he only hopes that you "might find the message of this story meaningful and applicable to your own life." If that is the standard, most readers should be satisfied.<i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>RICHARD PAUL EVANS is the #1 best-selling author of <i>The Christmas Box</i>. His fourteen novels have each appeared on the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list; there are more than thirteen million copies of his books in print. His books have been translated into more than 22 languages and several have been international best sellers. He is the winner of the 1998 American Mothers Book Award, two first place <i>Storytelling World</i> Awards for his children&#x2019;s books, and the 2005 Romantic Times Best Women Novel of the Year Award.&nbsp; Evans received the Washington Times Humanitarian of the Century Award and the Volunteers of America National Empathy Award for his work helping abused children.&nbsp;Evans lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with his wife, Keri, and their five children.</p><h2>Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist</h2><p>Academy Award winning animator Chuck Jones looks back on his life and career, and explains how he and his fellow animators created cartoon characters</p><p><i>Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist</i> is a sort of autobiography of Chuck Jones, the brilliant Warner Brothers animator who created such enduring characters as Wile E. Coyote and Marvin the Martian. Like his best cartoons, Jones skips around to the fun parts, giving a bit of childhood here, a few words of drawing advice there, and a good yarn wherever one fits. Jones also manages to work in a detailed yet somehow never boring description of the long and silly process of making a cartoon. Jones is refreshingly generous about spreading credit around to others. He fondly remembers art teachers, tips his hat to fellow directors and mentors Friz Freleng and Tex Avery, and gives the reader a new appreciation of the layout men who create the backgrounds for animated features. Most engaging are Jones's accounts of office life at Warner Brothers, which sounds like just as much fun as you hope it would be. Jones recounts stories of drawing tables wired to wake up sleeping animators when the boss approached and Cal Howard, a gag writer who ran an illegal commissary out of his metal-lined desk. The book is filled with sketches and color plates of much-loved moments from Warner Brothers cartoons and even includes a quick Road Runner and Coyote scene that comes to life when the pages are flipped. Highly recommended for kids who like to draw and adults who have not lost their appreciation for Looney Toons. <i>--Ali Davis</i>The illustrated classic, complete with a new preface by Matt Groening and foreword by Steven Spielberg. <p>Winner of three Academy Awards and numerous other prizes for his animated films, Chuck Jones is the director of scores of Warner Bros.' most famous cartoons and the creator of such beloved characters as the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, Pep Le Pew, and Marvin Martian. In this widely acclaimed memoir, Jones evokes the golden years of life at "Termite Terrace," the Warner Bros. studio where he and his now-famous fellow animators--such as Tex Avery and Friz Freleng--conceived the cartoons that have continued to delight generations of fans worldwide for over fifty years.</p></p><h2>Healing Fiction</h2><p>This book is Hillman&#39;s main analysis of analysis. He asks the basic question, &#34;What does the soul want?&#34; With insight and humor he answers, &#34;It wants fictions that heal.&#34;</p><p>The pioneering imaginative psychology of James Hillman that soon will span five decades has entered cultural history, affecting lives and minds in a wide range of fields. For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul&#39;s Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages. The American public showed its appreciation of his approach to psychology by placing his book, The Soul&#39;s Code, at the top of the bestseller list of serious works of nonfiction. Of his many books, Spring Publications has published Anima, Loose Ends, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account, Pan and the Nightmare, Suicide and the Soul, Insearch, Oedipus Variations (with Karl Ker�nyi), The Thought of the Heart and the Soul of the World, Inter Views, and Lectures on Jung&#39;s Typology (with Marie-Louise von Franz). He lives in Connecticut.Freud, Jung, and Adler&#x2039;post-Jungian Hillman stresses the metaphorical and mythic core of each man's work. All three . . . were often aware of the fictional nature of their theory and practice. Yet, argues Hillman, it is only when a fiction is taken literally that it becomes a lie, hence the double meaning of the title. Our symptoms and fixations are symbolic constructs; when our visions harden into dogmatic realties we become sick. -Library Journal</p><h2>Broken Ice: A Novel (Nils Shapiro, 2)</h2><p><p>In the words of Lee Child on <i>Gone to Dust</i>, &#x201c;I want more of Nils Shapiro.&#x201d; Emmy-award winning and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Matt Goldman happily obliges by bringing the Minneapolis private detective back for another thrilling, standalone adventure in <i>Broken Ice</i>.</p><p>Nils Shapiro has been hired to find missing Linnea Engstrom, a teenager from the small northern hockey town of Warroad, MN.

Here two men are destined for an explosive collision: John Sutter, Wall Street lawyer, holding fast to a fading aristocratic legacy; and Frank Bellarosa, the Mafia don who seizes his piece of the staid and unprepared Gold Coast like a latter-day barbarian chief and draws Sutter and his regally beautiful wife, Susan, into his violent world. Told from Sutter&#39;s sardonic and often hilarious point of view, and laced with sexual passion and suspense, THE GOLD COAST is Nelson DeMille&#39;s captivating story of friendship and seduction, love and betrayal.</p><p>Nelson DeMille is a former U.S. Army lieutenant who served in Vietnam and is the author of nineteen acclaimed novels, including the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Night Fall, Plum Island, The Gate House, The Lion</i>, <i>The Panther</i> and <i>Radiant Angel</i>. His other <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers include <i>The Charm School, Word of Honor, The Gold Coast, Spencerville, The Lion's Game, Up Country, Wild Fire</i>, and <i>The General's Daughter</i>, the last of which was a major motion picture. For more information, you can visit NelsonDeMille.net.The Long Island Gold Coast once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America. Mafia don Frank Bellarosa, a late-twentieth-century version of wealth and power, acquires the estate next to John Sutter, respected Wall Street tax lawyer. Like a moth to the flame, Sutter is drawn into Bellorosa&#39;s world. The story, first published in 1990, is told in Sutter&#39;s words, and Christian Rummel&#39;s narration is sterling. From the Gold Coast upper-crust accent known as &#34;Locust Valley lockjaw&#34; to the streetwise banter of the Mob, each character comes to life. Conversations between Sutter and Bellarosa are so realistic listeners may feel they&#39;re tied into a federal wiretap. With authentic settings and real people, THE GOLD COAST (now followed by a sequel, THE GATE HOUSE) provides an entertaining view of the sordid lives of the rich and famous. T.J.M.

The new commuter lifestyle has caused a drop in attendance at the local school, and officials are threatening closure. Miss Read worries about the failing health of Dolly Clare. Vegetable gardens have given way to trips to the Caxley markets, and the traditional village fete now includes a prize for best quiche. With her trademark patience and good humor, Miss Read hopes for the best and plans for the worst as the village grows increasingly modern. Despite all the innovations, Fairacre still retains its essential elements: gentle wit, good manners, and the comfort of caring neighbors.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>Even Fairacre, England, is feeling the intrusion of the modern world in 1991. Miss Read herself is the heroine of this chronicle of village life. June Barrie has the joy of musing aloud on the changes, both welcome and worrisome, for this head teacher of Fairacre School. The most pressing of all problems is the possibility that the tiny school may have to close. In this book, unlike many of the others in the series, Miss Read travels to Wales and to Scotland, so, if somewhat minimally, the listener hears Barrie's capability with other accents. The overwhelming feeling of coziness and sanity that these books exude is augmented by Barrie's clear and warm tone. The combination of her voice and the story is spellbinding.

Leaving school in 1817, he spent three years in St Petersburg working in the Foreign Office and writing erotic verse. His flirtations with pre-Decembrist movements and his revolutionary verses lead to his exile in 1820. After a stay in the Caucasus and Crimea he was sent to Bessarabia, where he began to write more seriously, beginning <b>Eugene Onegin</b> and <b>Tsygany</b>. In 1831 he retired to a family estate, married, and his literary output slackened. He was mortally wounded in a duel and died in January 1837. <br><br><b> Rosemary Edmonds</b> was born in London and studied languages in England, France and Italy.

Labeled as corsairs and buccaneers for methods that bordered on piracy, the brothers ran a privateering cooperative that provided contraband goods to a hungry market and made life hell for Spanish merchants on the Gulf. Later they became important members of a syndicate in New Orleans that included lawyers, bankers, merchants, and corrupt U.S. officials. But this allegiance didn't stop them from becoming paid Spanish spies, handing over information about the syndicate's plans and selling out their own associates. <br><br>In 1820 the Laffites disappeared into the fog of history from which they had emerged, but not before becoming folk heroes in French Louisiana and making their names synonymous with piracy and intrigue on the Gulf. <br></p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-100403-X<br>"[A] swashbuckling look at Jean and Pierre Laffite, brothers and partners in crime."

Valente,</b> acclaimed author of many books for adults, made her children's book debut with <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i>. She lives on an island off the coast of Maine with her husband.</p>CHAPTER I <br> <br>EXEUNT IN A ROWBOAT, PURSUED BY CROWS <br> <i>In Which a Girl Named September Keeps a Secret, Has a Difficult Time at School, Turns Thirteen, and Is Finally Nearly Run over by a Rowboat, Thereby Finding Her Way into Fairyland</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Once upon a time, a girl named September had a secret. <br>Now, secrets are delicate things. They can fill you up with sweetness and leave you like a cat who has found a particularly fat sparrow to eat and did not get clawed or bitten even once while she was about it. But they can also get stuck inside you, and very slowly boil up your bones for their bitter soup. Then the secret has you, not the other way around. So we may be very glad that September had the better of her secret, and carried it with her like a pair of rich gloves which, when she was cold, she could take out and slip on to remember the warmth of days gone by. <br>September&#x2019;s secret was this: She had been to Fairyland. <br>This has happened to other children in the history of the world. There are many books about it, and for ever so long little boys and girls have been reading them and making wooden swords and paper centaurs and waiting for their turn. But for September, the waiting had ended last spring. She had fought a wicked queen and saved a whole country from her cruelty. She had made friends who, in addition to being funny and brave and clever, were a Wyvern, a Marid, and a talking lamp. <br>The only trouble was, precious few books about swashbuckling folk have much to say on the subject of how to behave when one gets home. September had changed profoundly from a girl who desperately wanted such things to be real to one who knew they were real. Such a change is less like getting a new haircut than getting a new head. <br>It did not particularly improve her school life. <br>Where once September seemed merely and quietly odd, staring out the window during Mathematics lectures and reading big colorful books under her desk during Civics, now the other children sensed something wild and foreign about her. The girls in her grade could not have said what it was about September that so enraged them. If you sat them down and asked them about it, the best they could have managed might have been, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just not like us.&#x201d; <br>And so they did not invite her to birthday parties; they did not ask about her summer vacation. They did steal her books and tell lies about her to their teachers. &#x201c;September cheats on her algebra,&#x201d; they revealed in strictest confidence. &#x201c;September reads ugly old books during physical exercise.&#x201d; &#x201c;September goes behind the chemistry building with boys.&#x201d; They snickered behind her back in tones that sent up prickly hedges all around their tight huddles of lace dresses and ribboned curls. They stood on the inside of those hedges, the whispers said, and September would always stand on the outside. <br>Against all this, September held her secret. When she felt awful and lonely and cold, she would take it out and blow upon it like an ember, until it glowed again and filled her up: A-Through-L, her Wyverary, snuffling at Saturday&#x2019;s blue cheek until he laughed, and the Green Wind stamping his emerald snowshoes in the wheat. All of them waiting for her to come back, which she would&#x2014;soon, so terribly soon, any moment now. She felt very much like her Aunt Margaret, who had never seemed quite the same after coming home from her travels. She would tell long stories about Paris and silk trousers and red accordions and bulldogs and no one understood her particularly. But they listened politely until she trailed off, looking out the window as if she might see the river Seine flowing by instead of acre after acre of wheat and corn. September felt she understood her Aunt now, and resolved to be specially attentive toward her when she visited again. <br>Every evening, September carried on. She washed the same pink-and-yellow teacups that she had always washed, minded the same small and increasingly anxious dog she had always minded, and listened to the tall walnut-wood radio for bulletins about the war, about her father. The radio loomed so tall and huge in their parlor that it seemed to her like a terrible door, ready to open at any moment and let bad news in. As the sun set on the long yellow prairie each day, she kept a keen eye out for a flash of green on the horizon, a spotted pelt flashing through the grass, a certain laugh, a certain purr. But autumn dealt its days like a pack of golden cards, and no one came. <br>Her mother had Sundays off from the airplane factory, and so September fell in love with Sundays. They would sit together comfortably by the fire and read while the dog worried their shoelaces, or her mother would slide under Mr. Albert&#x2019;s miserable old Model A and bang at it until September could turn the key and hear it grumble into life once more. Not so long ago her mother read out loud to her from some book or other concerning fairies or soldiers or pioneers, but now they read companionably, each to their own novels or newspapers, quite as September remembered her mother doing with her father, before the war. Sundays were the best days, when the sunlight seemed to last forever, and September would bloom under her mother&#x2019;s big, frank smile. On Sundays, she didn&#x2019;t hurt. She didn&#x2019;t miss a place she could never explain to a grown-up person. She didn&#x2019;t wish her small dinner with its meager ration of tinned beef were a fey feast of candy and roasted hearts and purple melons full of rainwater wine. <br>On Sundays, she almost didn&#x2019;t think about Fairyland at all. <br>Sometimes she considered telling her mother about everything that had happened. Sometimes she burned to do it. But something older and wiser within her said, <i>Some things are for hiding and for keeping</i>. She feared that if she said it out loud it would all vanish, it would never have been, it would blow away like dandelion cotton. What if none of it had been real? What if she had dreamed it, or worse, had lost her mind like her father&#x2019;s cousin in Iowa City? Any of these were too awful to consider, but she could not help considering all the same. <br>Whenever she thought those dark thoughts, that she might just be a silly girl who had read too many books, that she might be mad, September glanced behind her and shuddered. For she had proof that it had all really happened. She had lost her shadow there, on a distant river, near a distant city. She had lost something big and true, and could not get it back. And if anyone should notice that she cast no shadow before or behind, September would have to tell. But while her secret remained secret, she felt she could bear it all&#x2014;the girls at school, her mother&#x2019;s long shifts, her father&#x2019;s absence. She could even bear the looming radio crackling away like an endless fire. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Nearly a year had passed since September had come home from Fairyland. Being quite a practical child, she had become very interested in mythology since her exploits on the other side of the world, studying up on the ways of fairies and old gods and hereditary monarchs and other magical folk. From her research, she reasoned that a year was just about right. One big, full turn of the sun. Surely the Green Wind would be sailing back over the sky for her any day, laughing and leaping and alliterating his way back into her world. And since the Marquess had been defeated and the locks of Fairyland undone, this time September would have no awful feats to perform, no harsh tests of her courage, only delight and fun and blackberry trifles. <br>But the Green Wind did not come. <br>As the end of spring neared, she began to worry in earnest. Time ran differently in Fairyland&#x2014;what if she turned eighty before a year passed there? What if the Green Wind came and found an old lady complaining of gout? Well, of course September would go with him anyway&#x2014;she would not hesitate if she were eighteen or eighty! But old women faced certain dangers in Fairyland, such as breaking a hip while riding a wild velocipede, or having everyone do what you say just because you had wrinkles. That last would not be <i>so</i> bad&#x2014;perhaps September could be a fabulous withered old witch and learn to cackle. She could get quite good at that. But it was so long to wait! Even the small and gloomy-faced dog had begun to stare pointedly at her, as if to say, <i>Shouldn&#x2019;t you be getting along now?</i> <br>And worse, what if the Green Wind had forgotten her? Or found another girl quite as capable as September at defeating wickedness and saying clever things? What if everyone in Fairyland had simply dropped a curtsy for the favor and gone about their business, giving no more thought to their little human friend? What if no one ever came for her again? <br>September turned thirteen. She did not even bother inviting anyone to a party. Instead, her mother gave her a stack of ration cards tied with a velvety brown ribbon. She had saved them up for months. Butter, sugar, salt, flour! And at the store, Mrs. Bowman gave them a little packet of cocoa powder to crown it all. September and her mother made a cake together in their kitchen, the small and frantic dog leaping to lick at the wooden spoon. The treat had so little chocolate that it came out the color of dust, but to September it tasted wonderful. Afterward, they went to a film about spies. September got a whole bag of popcorn to herself, and toffees as well. She felt dizzy with the lavishness of it all! It was almost as good as a Sunday, especially since she&#x2019;d gotten three new books wrapped specially in green paper, one of them in French, sent all the way from a village liberated by her father. (We may be certain September&#x2019;s father had help in liberating the village, but as far as she was concerned he had done it single-handed. Possibly at the point of a golden sword, atop a glorious black horse. Sometimes September found it very difficult to think of her father&#x2019;s war without thinking of her own.) Of course she could not read it, but he had written in the cover, &#x201c;I will see you soon, my girl.&#x201d; And that made it the greatest book ever written. It had illustrations, too, of a girl not older than September sitting on the moon and reaching out to catch stars in her hands, or standing on a high lunar mountain conversing with a strange red hat with two long feathers sticking out of it that floated right next to her as pert as you please. September pored over it all the way to the theatre, trying to say the strange-sounding words, trying to tell what the story was meant to be. <br>They demolished the dust-colored birthday cake and September&#x2019;s mother put the kettle on. The dog set upon a powerfully satisfactory marrow bone. September took her new books up and went out into the fields to watch the dusk come down and think. She heard the radio crackling and talking as she let herself out the back door, the pop and spit of static following her like a gray shadow. <br>September lay down in the long May grass. She looked up through the golden-green stalks of grain. The sky glowed deep blue and rose, and a little yellow star came on like a lightbulb in the warm evening. <i>That&#x2019;s Venus,</i> September thought. <i>She was the goddess of love. It&#x2019;s nice that love comes on first thing in the evening, and goes out last in the morning. Love keeps the light on all night. Whoever thought to call it Venus ought to get full marks.</i> <br>We may forgive our girl for ignoring the sound at first. For once, she had not been looking for strange sounds or signs. For once, she had not been thinking about Fairyland at all, but about a girl talking to a red hat and what that could possibly mean, and how wonderful it was that her father had got a whole village liberated. Anyway, rustling is quite a common noise when fields of wheat and wild grass are involved. She heard it, and a little breeze ruffled the pages of her birthday books, but she did not look up until the rowboat flew at ripping speed over her head on the tips of the wheatstalks as if they were waves. <br>September leapt up and saw two figures in a little black boat, oars spinning furiously, bouncing swiftly over the fields. One had a broad hat on, slick and dark like a fisherman&#x2019;s. The other trailed a long silver hand out over the furry heads of dry grain. The arm sparkled metallic, shining, a woman&#x2019;s slim wrist gleaming metal, her hand tipped with iron fingernails. September could not see their faces&#x2014;the man&#x2019;s back hunched huge and wide, obscuring the silver lady, save her arm. <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; September cried, running after the boat as fast as she could go. She knew Fairylandish happenings when she saw them, and she could see them bouncing away from her right that very moment. &#x201c;Wait, I&#x2019;m here!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Better look out for the Alleyman,&#x201d; called the man in the black slicker, looking back over his shoulder. Shadows hid his face, but his voice seemed familiar, a kind of broken, unruly rasping September could almost place. &#x201c;The Alleyman comes with his rag cart and bone truck, and he&#x2019;s got all our names on a list.&#x201d; <br>The silver lady cupped the wind with her shining hand. &#x201c;I was cutting barbed wire before you were cutting your milk teeth, old man. Don&#x2019;t try to impress me with your slang and your free verse and your winning ways.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Please wait!&#x201d; September called after them. Her lungs clenched tight and thick. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep up!&#x201d; <br>But they only rowed faster, over the tips of the fields, and the night had its face on right and proper now. <i>Oh, I&#x2019;ll never catch them!</i> September thought frantically, and her heart squeezed. For though, as we have said, all children are heartless, this is not precisely true of teenagers. Teenage hearts are raw and new, fast and fierce, and they do not know their own strength. Neither do they know reason or restraint, and if you want to know the truth, a goodly number of grown-up hearts never learn it. And so we may say now, as we could not before, that September&#x2019;s heart squeezed, for it had begun to grow in her like a flower in the dark. We may also take a moment to feel a little sorry for her, for having a heart leads to the peculiar griefs of the grown. <br>September, then, her raw, unripe heart squeezing with panic, ran harder. She had waited so long, and now they were getting away. She was too small, too slow. How could she bear it, how could she ever bear it if she missed her chance? Her breath came too tight and too fast and tears started at the corners of her eyes, only to be whipped away as she ran on, stamping down old corn and the occasional blue flower. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here!&#x201d; she squeaked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me! Don&#x2019;t go!&#x201d; <br>The silver lady glittered in the distance. September tried so hard to see them, to catch them, to run faster, just a little faster. Let us lean in close and nip at her heels, let us whisper in her ear: Come now, you can do more, you can catch them, girl, you can stretch out your arms just a little further! <br>And she did clamber faster, she did stretch further, she did move through the grass and did not see the low, mossy wall cutting suddenly through the field until she had tripped and tumbled over it. September landed facedown in a field of grass so white it seemed as though snow had just fallen, except that the lawn was cool and smelled marvelously sweet, quite like a lemon ice. <br>Her book lay forgotten on the suddenly empty grass of our world. A sudden wind, smelling ever so faintly of every green thing, of mint and rosemary and fresh hay, turned the pages faster and faster, as if in a hurry to find out the end. <br>September&#x2019;s mother stepped out of the house, looking for her daughter, her eyes puffy with tears. But there was no girl in the wheat anymore, only three brand-new books, a bit of toffee still in its wax wrapper, and a pair of crows winging off, cawing after...</p><h2>Tea-Time at the Masters: A Collection of Recipes</h2><p>Tea-Time at the Masters?? is an absolute must for the serious collector of cookbooks???as well as the avid golfer.

Subtitled "The Fabled Life and Untimely Death of the Original Baltimore Orioles, the Team That Gave Birth to Modern Baseball," Solomon's splendidly energetic examination of one of the sport's most powerful and storied franchises stands as a fascinating--and cautionary--study of how a team, regardless of quality, can simply implode. And what a team the Orioles of the 1890s was: manager Ned Hanlon and stars Wee Willie Keeler, John McGraw, Hugh Jennings, Wilbert Robinson, Dan Brouthers, Iron Man McGinnity, and Joe Kelley all deserve their plaques in Cooperstown. As a unit, they created "scientific baseball," redefining the way the game was played and dominating the National League. Yet, by 1903, to Baltimore's horror and confusion, there were no more Orioles. A series of self-destructive choices successfully conspired to export their best players to Brooklyn and remove the franchise--now a member of the American League and playing in New York as the Highlanders--from the Major League standings for nearly half a century. <p> A fine reporter and writer, Solomon does a remarkable job of bringing the past into the present, exploring how little has changed in terms of baseball business and organizational stupidity through the years. With its marvelous cast of real--and fully realized--characters, <i>Where They Ain't</i> reads as much like a novel as it does like history, and though we know how it ends, it remains an important story worth telling, learning from, and certainly remembering. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>, the legendary Baltimore Orioles of the National League [sic] under the tutelage of manager Ned Hanlon, perfected a style of play known as &#34;scientific baseball,&#34; featuring such innovations as the sacrifice bunt, the hit- and-run, the squeeze play, and the infamous Baltimore chop. Its best hitter, Wee Willie Keeler, had the motto &#34;keep your eye clear and hit &#39;em where they ain&#39;t&#34;--which he did. He and his colorful teammates, fierce third-baseman John McGraw, avuncular catcher Wibert Robinson, and heartthrob center fielder Joe Kelly, won three straight pennants from 1894 to 1896. But the Orioles were swept up and ultimately destroyed in a business intrigue involving the political machines of three large cities and collusion with the ambitious men who ran the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers. Burt Solomon narrates the rise and fall of this colorful franchise as a cautionary tale of greed and overreaching that speaks volumes as well about the enterprise of baseball a century later.</p><h2>No Rest for the Dead</h2><p><b>More than twenty <i>New York Times </i>bestselling authors team up to create a first-rate serial novel -- a collaboration that combines the skills of America&#x2019;s greatest storytellers to produce a gripping, spellbinding mystery.</b> <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;The lineup of writers who have contributed to this mystery is akin to the Murderers&#x2019; Row of the 1927 New York Yankees.

Ten years later, Jon Nunn, the detective who cracked the case, is convinced that the wrong person was put to death.&nbsp;In the years since the case was closed, he's discovered a web of deceit and betrayal surrounding the Thomases that could implicate any&nbsp;number of people in the crime. With the help of the dead woman's friend, he plans&nbsp;to gather everyone who was there the night Christopher died and finally uncover the truth, suspect by suspect.

When I say &#x201c;observing,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not talking about passively watching. I&#x2019;m talking about staring--the kind of raw, unblinking, intensely absorbed gazes you see in hungry cats or newborn babies.<br><br>We each live with a &#x201c;windshield&#x201d; of people in front of us; one of the keys to igniting your motivation is to fill your windshield with vivid images of your future self, and to stare at them every day. Studies show that even a brief connection with a role model can vastly increase unconscious motivation. For example, being told that you share a birthday with a mathematician can improve the amount of effort you&#x2019;re willing to put into difficult math tasks by 62 percent.<br><br>Many talent hotbeds are fueled by the windshield phenomenon. In 1997, there were no South Korean golfers on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour. Today there are more than forty, winning one-third of all events. What happened? One golfer succeeded (Se Ri Pak, who won two major tournaments in 1998), and, through her, hundreds of South Korean girls were ignited by a new vision of their future selves. As the South Korean golfer Christina Kim put it, &#x201c;You say to yourself, &#x2018;If she can do it, why can&#x2019;t I?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Windshields apply equally well to adults. The 5th Special Forces Group of the Green Berets recently started a leadership-training program in which soldiers spent several weeks in the executive offices of General Electric. The soldiers went to the office each morning and accompanied the execs throughout their workday, with no responsibilities other than to simply observe. And when the soldiers returned to their unit, the commanders noticed a significant boost in performance, communication, and leadership. &#x201c;It was definitely a success,&#x201d; said Lieutenant Colonel Dean Franks, the 5th Group&#x2019;s battalion commander. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re planning to do a lot more of this in the future.&#x201d;<br><br>Think of your windshield as an energy source for your brain. Use pictures (the walls of many talent hotbeds are cluttered with photos and posters of their stars) or, better, video. One idea: Bookmark a few YouTube videos, and watch them before you practice, or at night before you go to bed.<br><br>Tip #2<br><br>Spend fifteen minutes a day engraving the skill on your brain<br><br>What&#x2019;s the best way to begin to learn a new skill? Is it by listening to a teacher&#x2019;s explanation? Reading an instructional book? Just leaping in and trying it out? Many hotbeds use an approach I call the engraving method. Basically, they watch the skill being performed, closely and with great intensity, over and over, until they build a high-definition mental blueprint.<br><br>A few years back, for the TV show 60 Minutes, the tennis teacher and author Timothy Gallwey assembled a group of middle-aged people who&#x2019;d never played tennis before. He gave them a brief test of ability, and then selected the woman who showed the least potential. Then, without uttering a word, Gallwey began to hit a forehand while the woman watched. He directed her attention to his feet, his grip, and the rhythm of the stroke. The woman watched intently, then began to emulate his moves. Within twenty minutes, she was hitting a shockingly decent forehand.<br><br>Another example of engraving, which involves the ears instead of the eyes, is the Suzuki method for learning music. Each day, separate from their lessons, Suzuki students listen to a menu of songs, beginning with &#x201c;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&#x201d; and progressing by degrees to more complex tunes. Hearing the songs over and over (and over), engraves the songs in the students&#x2019;s brains. The &#x201c;listening practice&#x201d; builds a strong, detailed mental map, a series of points from which the success or failure of each following attempt can be measured.<br><br>The key to effective engraving is to create an intense connection: to watch and listen so closely that you can imagine the feeling of performing the skill. For physical skills, project yourself inside the performer&#x2019;s body. Become aware of the movement, the rhythm; try to feel the interior shape of the moves. For mental skills, simulate the skill by re-creating the expert&#x2019;s decision patterns. Chess players achieve this by replaying classic games, move by move; public speakers do it by regiving great speeches complete with original inflections; musicians cover their favorite songs; some writers I know achieve this effect by retyping passages verbatim from great works. (It sounds kind of Zen, but it works.)<br><br>Tip #3<br><br>Steal without apology<br><br>We are often told that talented people acquire their skill by following their &#x201c;natural instincts.&#x201d; This sounds nice, but in fact it is baloney. All improvement is about absorbing and applying new information, and the best source of information is top performers. So steal it.<br><br>Stealing has a long tradition in art, sports, and design, where it often goes by the name of &#x201c;influence.&#x201d; The young Steve Jobs stole the idea for the computer mouse and drop-down menus from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The young Beatles stole the high &#x201c;wooooo&#x201d; sounds in &#x201c;She Loves You,&#x201d; &#x201c;From Me to You,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Twist and Shout&#x201d; from their idol Little Richard. The young Babe Ruth based his swing on the mighty uppercut of his hero, Shoeless Joe Jackson. As Pablo Picasso (no slouch at theft himself) put it, &#x201c;Good artists borrow. Great artists steal.&#x201d;<br><br>Linda Septien, founder of the Septien School of Contemporary Music, a hotbed near Dallas that has produced millions of dollars in pop-music talent (including Demi Lovato, Ryan Cabrera, and Jessica Simpson), tells her students, &#x201c;Sweetheart, you gotta steal like crazy. Look at every single performer better than you and see what they&#x2019;ve got that you can use. Then make it your own.&#x201d; Septien follows her own advice, having accumulated fourteen three-ring notebooks&#x2019; worth of ideas stolen from top performers. In plastic sleeves inside the binders, in some cases scribbled on cocktail napkins, reside tips on everything from how to hit a high note to how to deal with a rowdy crowd (a joke works best).<br><br>Stealing helps shed light on some mysterious patterns of talent--for instance, why the younger members of musical families so often are also the most talented. (A partial list: The Bee Gees&#x2019;s younger brother, Andy Gibb; Michael Jackson; the youngest Jonas Brother, Nick. Not to mention Mozart, J. S. Bach, and Yo-Yo Ma, all babies of their families.) The difference can be explained partly by the windshield phenomenon (see Tip #1) and partly by theft. As they grow up, the younger kids have more access to good information. They have far more opportunity to watch their older siblings perform, to mimic, to see what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. In other words, to steal.<br><br>When you steal, focus on specifics, not general impressions. Capture concrete facts: the angle of a golfer&#x2019;s left elbow at the top of the backswing; the curve of a surgeon&#x2019;s wrist; the precise shape and tension of a singer&#x2019;s lips as he hits that high note; the exact length of time a comedian pauses before delivering the punch line. Ask yourself:<br><br>* What, exactly, are the critical moves here?<br><br>* How do they perform those moves differently than I do?<br><br>Tip #4<br><br>Buy a notebook<br><br>A high percentage of top performers keeps some form of daily performance journal. Tennis champion Serena Williams and former World Series MVP Curt Schilling use notebooks; the rapper Eminem and the choreographer Twyla Tharp use shoeboxes, which they fill with ideas written on scrap paper. What matters is not the precise form. What matters is that you write stuff down and reflect on it. Results from today. Ideas for tomorrow. Goals for next week. A notebook works like a map: It creates clarity.<br><br>Tip #5<br><br>Be willing to be stupid<br><br>Teammates of the hockey star Wayne Gretzky would occasionally witness a strange sight: Gretzky falling while he skated through solitary drills on the ice. While the spectacle of the planet&#x2019;s greatest hockey player toppling over like a grade-schooler might seem surprising, it actually makes perfect sense. As skilled as he was, Gretzky was determined to improve, to push the boundaries of the possible. The only way that happens is to build new connections in the brain--which means reaching, failing, and, yes, looking stupid.<br><br>Feeling stupid is no fun. But being willing to be stupid--in other words, being willing to risk the emotional pain of making mistakes--is absolutely essential, because reaching, failing, and reaching again is the way your brain grows and forms new connections. When it comes to developing talent, remember, mistakes are not really mistakes--they are the guideposts you use to get better.</p><h2>The Maytrees: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Brilliant. . . .

H. Smith Literary Award; <i>The Comfort of Strangers</i> and <i>Black Dogs</i>, both shortlisted for the Booker Prize; <i>Amsterdam</i>, winner of the Booker Prize; and <i>The Child in Time</i>, winner of the Whitbread Award; as well as the story collections <i>First Love, Last Rites</i>, winner of the Somerset Maugham Award; and <i>In Between the Sheets</i>. He lives in London.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He belonged to that class of men&#x2014;vaguely unprepossessing, often bald, short, fat, clever&#x2014;who were unaccountably attractive to certain beautiful women. Or he believed he was, and thinking seemed to make it so. And it helped that some women believed he was a genius in need of rescue. But the Michael Beard of this time was a man of narrowed mental condition, anhedonic, monothematic, stricken. His fifth marriage was disintegrating, and he should have known how to behave, how to take the long view, how to take the blame. Weren&#x2019;t marriages, his marriages, tidal, with one rolling out just before another rolled in? But this one was different. He did not know how to behave, long views pained him, and for once there was no blame for him to assume, as he saw it. It was his wife who was hav�ing the affair, and having it flagrantly, punitively, certainly without remorse. He was discovering in himself, among an array of emo�tions, intense moments of shame and longing. Patrice was seeing a builder, their builder, the one who had repointed their house, fitted their kitchen, retiled their bathroom, the very same heavyset fellow who in a tea break had once shown Michael a photo of his&nbsp; mock-Tudor house, renovated and tudorized by his own hand, with a boat on a trailer under a Victorian-style lamppost on the concreted front driveway, and space on which to erect a decommissioned red phone box. Beard was surprised to find how complicated it was to be the cuckold. Misery was not simple. Let no one say that this late in life he was immune to fresh experience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had it coming. His four previous wives, Maisie, Ruth, Eleanor, Karen, who all still took a distant interest in his life, would have been exultant, and he hoped they would not be told. None of his mar�riages had lasted more than six years, and it was an achievement of sorts to have remained childless. His wives had discovered early on what a poor or frightening prospect of a father he presented, and they had protected themselves and got out. He liked to think that if he had caused unhappiness, it was never for long, and it counted for some�thing that he was still on speaking terms with all his exes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not with his current wife. In better times, he might have pre�dicted for himself a manly embrace of double standards, with bouts of dangerous fury, perhaps an episode of drunken roaring in the back garden late at night, or writing off her car, and the calculated pursuit of a younger woman, a Samson-like toppling of the marital temple. Instead he was paralyzed by shame, by the extent of his humiliation. Even worse, he amazed himself with his inconvenient longing for her. These days, desire for Patrice came on him out of nowhere, like an attack of stomach cramp. He would have to sit somewhere alone and wait for it to pass. Apparently there was a certain kind of husband who thrilled at the notion of his wife with other men. Such a man might arrange to have himself bound and gagged and locked in the bedroom wardrobe while ten feet away his better half went at it. Had Beard at last located within himself a capacity for sexual masochism?&nbsp;No woman had ever looked or sounded so desirable as the wife he suddenly could not have. Conspicuously, he went to Lisbon to look up an old friend, but it was a joyless three nights. He had to have his wife back, and dared not drive her away with shouting or threats or brilliant moments of unreason. Nor was it in his nature to plead. He was frozen, he was abject, he could think of nothing else. The first time she left him a note&#x2014;<i>Staying over at R&#x2019;s tonight. xx P&#x2014;</i>did he go round to the&nbsp;mock-Tudor&nbsp;ex-council semi with the shrouded speed�boat on the hard standing and a hot tub in the&nbsp; pint- sized backyard to mash the man&#x2019;s brains with his own monkey wrench? No, he watched television for five hours in his overcoat, drank two bottles of wine, and tried not to think. And failed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thinking was all he had. When his other wives had found out about his affairs, they had raged, coldly or tearfully, they had insisted on long sessions into the early hours to deliver their thoughts on bro�ken trust, and eventually their demands for a separation and all that fol�lowed. But when Patrice happened across some&nbsp;e-mails from Suzanne Reuben, a mathematician at the Humboldt University in Berlin, she became unnaturally elated. That same afternoon she moved her clothes into the guest bedroom. It was a shock when he slid the wardrobe doors open to confirm the fact. Those rows of silk and cotton dresses, he realized now, had been a luxury and a comfort, versions of herself lining up to please him. No longer. Even the hangers were gone. She smiled through dinner that night as she explained that she too intended to be &#x201c;free,&#x201d; and within the week she had started her affair. What was a man to do? He apologized one breakfast, told her his lapse meant nothing, made grand promises he sincerely believed he might keep. This was the closest he came to pleading. She said she did not mind what he did. This was what she was doing&#x2014;and this was when she revealed the identity of her lover, the builder with the sin�ister name of Rodney Tarpin, seven inches taller and twenty years younger than the cuckold, whose sole reading, according to his boast, back when he was humbly grouting and beveling for the Beards, was the sports section of a tabloid newspaper.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An early sign of Beard&#x2019;s distress was dysmorphia, or perhaps it was dysmorphia he was suddenly cured of. At last he knew himself for what he was. Catching sight of a conical pink mess in the misted full- length mirror as he came out of the shower, he wiped down the glass, stood full on, and took a disbelieving look. What engines of&nbsp;self-persuasion had let him think for so many years that looking like this was seductive? That foolish thatch of earlobe-level hair that but�tressed his baldness, the new curtain swag of fat that hung below his armpits, the innocent stupidity of swelling in gut and rear. Once he had been able to improve on his mirror self by pinning back his shoul�ders, standing erect, tightening his abs. Now human blubber draped his efforts. How could he possibly keep hold of a young woman as beautiful as she was? Had he honestly thought that status was enough, that his Nobel Prize would keep her in his bed? Naked, he was a dis�grace, an idiot, a weakling. Even eight consecutive&nbsp; push- ups were beyond him. Whereas Tarpin could run up the stairs to the Beards&#x2019; master bedroom holding under one arm a fifty-kilo cement sack. Fifty kilos? That was roughly Patrice&#x2019;s weight.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kept him at a distance with lethal cheerfulness. These were additional insults, her singsong hellos, the matinal recital of domestic detail, and her evening whereabouts, and none of it would have mat�tered if he had been able to despise her a little and plan to be shot of her. Then they could have settled down to the brief, grisly disman�tling of a five-year childless marriage. Of course she was punishing him, but when he suggested that, she shrugged and said that she could just as easily have said the same of him. She had merely been waiting for this opportunity, he said, and she laughed and said that in that case she was grateful to him.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his delusional state, he was convinced that just as he was about to lose her, he had found the perfect wife. That summer of 2000 she was wearing different clothes, she had a different look around the house&#x2014;faded tight jeans, flip-flops, a ragged pink cardigan over a T-shirt, her blond hair cut short, her pale eyes a deeper agitated blue. Her build was slight, and now she looked like a teenager. From the empty rope- handled glossy carrier bags and tissue paper left strewn on the kitchen table for his inspection, he gathered she was buying herself new underwear for Tarpin to remove. She was&nbsp;thirty-four, and still kept the&nbsp;strawberries-and-cream look of her twenties. She did not tease or taunt or flirt with him&#x2014;that at least would have been communication of a sort&#x2014;but steadily perfected the bright indiffer�ence with which she intended to obliterate him.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He needed to cease needing her, but desire was not like that. He <i>wanted </i>to want her. One sultry night he lay uncovered on the bed and tried masturbating himself toward freedom. It bothered him that he could not see his genitalia unless his head was propped up on two pil�lows, and his fantasy was continually interrupted by Tarpin, who, like some ignorant stagehand with ladder and bucket, kept wandering onto the set. Was there another man on the planet apart from Beard attempting at this moment to pleasure himself with thoughts of his own wife just thirty feet away across the landing? The question emp�tied him of purpose. And it was too hot.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends used to tell him that Patrice resembled Marilyn Monroe, at least from certain angles and in a certain light. He had been happy to accept this status- enhancing comparison, but he never really saw it. Now he did. She had changed. There was a new fullness in her lower lip, a promise of trouble when she lowered her gaze, and her short�ened hair lay curled on her nape in a compelling, old-fashioned way. Surely she was more beautiful than Monroe, drifting about the house and garden at weekends in a haze of blond and pink and pale blue. What an adolescent color scheme he had fallen for, and at his age.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned&nbsp; fifty- three that July, and naturally she ignored his birthday, then pretended in her jolly new style to remember it three days later. She gave him a kipper ti...</p><h2>Slouching Towards Bethlehem (Modern Library)</h2><p>Upon its publication in 1968, <b>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</b> confirmed Joan Didion as one of the most prominent writers on the literary scene. Her unblinking vision and deadpan tone have influenced subsequent generations of reporters and essayists, changing our expectations of style, voice, and the artistic possibilities of nonfiction. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"In her portraits of people," <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> wrote, "Didion is not out to expose but to understand, and she shows us actors and millionaires, doomed brides and na�ve acid-trippers, left-wing ideologues and snobs of the Hawaiian aristocracy in a way that makes them neither villainous nor glamorous, but alive and botched and often mournfully beautiful. . . . A rare display of some of the best prose written today in this country."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In essay after essay, Didion captures the dislocation of the 1960s, the disorientation of a country shredding itself apart with social change. Her essays not only describe the subject at hand--the murderous housewife, the little girl trailing the rock group, the millionaire bunkered in his mansion--but also offer a broader vision of America, one that is both terrifying and tender, ominous and uniquely her own.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Joyce Carol Oates has written, "Joan Didion is one of the very few writers of our time who approaches her terrible subject with absolute seriousness, with fear and humility and awe. Her powerful irony is often sorrowful rather than clever. . . . She has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control."</p><p>"A slant vision that is arresting and unique . . . Didion might be an observer from another planet--one so edgy and alert that she ends up knowing more about our own world than we know ourselves."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Anne Tyler<br><br>"The story between the lines of Slouching Towards Bethlehem is surely not so much 'California' as it is [Didion's] ability to make us share her passionate sense of it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Alfred Kazin<br>Joan Didion&#39;s many books include The Year of Magical Thinking, for which she received the National Book Award.

During his lifetime Adams published seven books of images from this region; this new book brings the best of these early volumes together into a single work. His writings - alive with anecdote and insight - provide a backdrop for these stirring images, and an introduction by John Szarkowski, the most distinguished photography critic and curator of his time, provides testimony to the enduring impact of Adams&#39; Yosemite vision. Yosemite and the High Sierra represents Adams&#39; legacy at its most distilled and timeless.</p><p>In a career that spanned over five decades, Adams was at once America's foremost landscape photographer and one of its most ardent environmentalists.

Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamund and pioneering medical methods threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past. As their stories interweave, George Eliot creates a richly nuanced and moving drama, hailed by Virginia Woolf as &#39;one of the few English novels written for adult people&#39;.

Kristy Thomas's brilliant business plan gets off to a great start with the help of Claudia Kishi (vice-president), Mary Anne Spier (secretary), and Stacey McGill (treasurer). <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Inteview with Author Ann M. Martin</strong> <p> Q: It's been a decade since the last Baby-sitters Club books came out, and 24 years since the first book was published. What was it like to come back to the BSC after so many years away?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I had a great time re-visiting the characters. It was fun to explore their lives in the prequel, &#x201c;"The Summer Before," and to figure out what led the girls to form The Baby-sitters Club, something that would eventually change their lives. It was like a reunion with friends--friends who haven&#x2019;t changed a bit. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey are very different characters, which is in part why the series was and is still so popular. Every reader can relate to at least one of the characters. So, we have to ask you--which character are you most like?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I am most like Mary Anne who is the shy and quiet one. Like me, Mary Anne enjoys more solitary pursuits such as reading and needlework. My favorite character, however, is Kristy. I think she's my alter ego.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Were you allowed to baby-sit when you were twelve? If so, were they any funny or awful stories you'd like to share? <br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> Yes, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was twelve. One of the worst and also funniest things that ever happened was when I was baby-sitting for our neighbors and the kids wanted to wash their parents' car. They started the job with much enthusiasm--using Brillo pads. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> More than 200 BSC books were published in the eighties and nineties. Are there any that you are particularly fond of and why?<br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> My favorite Baby-sitters Club book is "Kristy's Great Idea," which is the first book and sets the series in motion. I also like the more serious books such as "Claudia and the Sad Good-bye," which deals with the death of Claudia&#x2019;s grandmother. This book was written shortly after my own grandmother died. My other favorite BSC books include &#x201c;Kristy and the Secret of Susan,&#x201d; in which the members of the BSC baby-sit for a child with autism, and "Jessi's Secret Language" in which the girls learn American Sign Language in order to communicate with a sitting charge with profound hearing impairment.<br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Why do you think that the series is so well-loved and has endured over so many years? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I think the characters in the BSC books are easily relatable. The books deal with timeless topics including friendship, family, and school. Also, the books tackle serious issues including racism, bullying, kids with disabilities (physical and mental), and death of a loved one. These issues were relevant to kids in the 1980s and 1990s, and are still relevant to kids today. In addition to being relatable, these are characters readers can aspire to. The kids run a business--in this case, a baby-sitting business. They are entrepreneurial, independent, creative, and confident. And at the heart of the series is the friendship--the "glue" that binds these characters. Sure, they have fights, but they're loyal and they support one another. I think a lot of us--even adults--can relate to that. <br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>"The Summer Before" takes place during the summer before the girls enter the seventh grade--where suddenly there's a ton of pressure to fit in. The months leading up to it can be filled with anxiety, excitement, and anticipation. Do you remember how you spent the summer before seventh grade? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I was nervous that summer because in the fall I would be going to a new school &#x2013; the junior high (this was in the time before middle schools). Even the words "junior high" seemed terribly grown-up. My friends and I would be attending school with eighth-graders, who were one step away from high school. I spent that summer reading, going to the community pool, taking a family trip to Cape May, New Jersey, doing some baby-sitting, and also recovering from surgery. But the knowledge that I would soon be in junior high school colored every day and every activity and did lend the summer an air of both anxiety and anticipation.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Despite the fun the girls have together in "The Summer Before," they're all dealing with pretty tough problems&#x2014;moving away, an absentee father, a first crush. How did you choose the issues you wanted to focus on?<br><br> <strong>Martin:&nbsp;</strong> One of my favorite things about writing a series was that the characters themselves generated plot ideas for later books. One of the themes that developed as the series progressed was that of Kristy's relationship with her father. It was an idea I enjoyed exploring, and when I had the opportunity to write the prequel I realized that this summer would be a charged time for Kristy, and that I could introduce the issues she had with her father here; then they could unfold in the later books. The same applied to Stacey. Her reasons for moving to Stoneybrook had been revealed in later books, but I realized that during this particular summer the reader could actually watch the events take place. The other issues &#x2013; a first crush, wanting more independence yet still feeling like a kid--are themes that I felt would resonate with most "tween" readers.<br><strong><br> Q: </strong>Even though the books have been out of print for ten years there are still some very devoted fans. Surely you must have received a ton of letters about the series over the years. Are there any that stick out in your mind?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> The most memorable are stories of girls who have written to me and told me that I&#x2019;ve made an impact on their lives, that The Baby-sitters Club books have turned them into readers. Some have also said that the BSC books made them aspire to become writers. I&#x2019;ve also heard from a lot of the original fans who grew up to become teachers, librarians, editors, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. To know that this series inspired a generation of readers and writers is very humbling. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation in the blogosphere about where Claudia, Kristy, Mary Ann, and Stacey would be now, in 2010, had they grown up. Do you have any thoughts on what path each would have taken?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong>&nbsp; I understand the fascination of the older BSC fans who would like to know what happened with the characters when they got older. It&#x2019;s thrilling to realize that after all these years the fans remain passionate about the books and the characters in The Baby-sitters Club. I can see Kristy running a business--I can also see her being in politics. I think Mary Anne became a teacher. I imagine Stacey went into fashion--not as a designer, but maybe on the business side. And Claudia became an artist. I think fans can fill in for the rest of the characters!<br><br> </p>Ann M.

The <i>elderly</i> naked dead man who&#x2019;d been riding shotgun in my cherry red Jeep Wrangler, aka Misery, for two days now. We were on a stakeout. Sort of. I was staking out a Mr. and Mrs. Foster, so I was definitely on a stakeout. No idea what Naked Dead Man was on. Considering the fact that he looked about 112, probably blood thinners. Cholesterol medication. And, judging from the state of his manhood, which I couldn&#x2019;t stop seeing <i>every single time</i> I turned toward him, Viagra. If I were to hashtag that moment, my status would read something like #impressed.</p> <p>I gave him two thumbs up, then looked back at the house again, happy to be sitting in Misery. The Jeep, not the emotion. I&#x2019;d just picked her up from the car hospital two days earlier. She&#x2019;d had several surgeries to fix her broken girlie bits because a raving lunatic rammed into her. He&#x2019;d knocked her into a state of mangled disrepair and me, as I was in the driver&#x2019;s seat at the time, into a state of oblivion. I stayed in that state long enough for Mr. Raving Lunatic to cart me off to a deserted bridge to kill me. He failed and died in the process, but Misery had paid a high price for his nefarious machinations. Why did bad guys always try to hurt the ones I loved?</p> <p>And this one had succeeded. Misery was hurt. Bad. No one wanted to work on her. Said she couldn&#x2019;t be saved. Said to give her over to the scrap yard. Thankfully, a family friend with a body shop and a few incriminating photos, which just happened to have found their way into my possession, agreed with great reluctance to try.</p> <p>Noni kept her for two long weeks before calling to tell me that he&#x2019;d almost lost her a couple of times, but she&#x2019;d pulled through with flying colors. When I got the green light to go pick her up, I tore out of my apartment so fast, I left a dust trail behind me, along with a flummoxed best friend, who&#x2019;d been telling me about the couple in 3C. They were apparently newlyweds, if their energy to do it&#x2014;her words&#x2014;all night every night was any indication. I hurried back to her, however, because I didn&#x2019;t have a car and I needed a ride.</p> <p>When we picked up Misery, Noni tried to tell me everything he&#x2019;d had to do to her to get her up and running, but I held up a hand to stop him, unable to bear it. This was Misery he was talking about. Not some random Wrangler off the streets. This was <i>my</i> Wrangler. My best friend. My baby.</p> <p>Holy cow, I needed a life.</p> <p>I had to hand it to Noni, though. Misery was good as new. Better than I was, anyway. Ever since that night, I&#x2019;d been having problems sleeping. I suffered from debilitating nightmares that left me screaming into my pillow, and I jumped every time someone dropped a feather.</p> <p>But at least Misery was okay. Like, really okay. It was weird. Her cough was gone. Her sluggish response time was no longer an issue. Her reluctance to wake up in the mornings as she sputtered in protest every time I tried to fire all engines was nonexistent. Now she started on the first try, no groaning or whining, and she purred like a newborn kitten. How Noni had managed to fix her insides as well as her outsides I&#x2019;d never know, but the guy was good. And Noni was my new best friend. Well, after Misery. And Cookie, my real best friend. And Garrett, my kind of, sort of best friend. And Reyes, my&nbsp;&#x2026; my&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>What was Reyes? Besides the dark and sultry son of evil? My boy toy? My love slave? My 24/7 booty call?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Well, yes.</p> <p>He was all those things, but he was also my almost fianc�. All I had to do was say yes to the proposal he&#x2019;d written on a sticky note, and he would be my fianc� for reals. Until then, however, he was my almost fianc�.</p> <p>No, my soon-to-be fianc�.</p> <p>No! My <i>nigh</i> fianc�.</p> <p>Yeah, that&#x2019;d work.</p> <p>I turned back to the naked dead man, stuffed a couple of Cheez-Its into my mouth, and confessed my latest sin.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just kidding,&#x201d; I said through the crackers, regretting the fact that I&#x2019;d tempted him and now had no follow-up. No punch line. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any &#x2018;girl, mocha latte, dead man&#x2019; jokes. Sorry to get your hopes up like that.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t seem to mind, however. He sat staring straight ahead as always, his gray eyes clouded and watery with age, oblivious of my charm, my clever repartee, and my intellectual wit. He was ignoring me!</p> <p>It happened.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cheez-It?&#x201d; I offered him.</p> <p>Nothing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, but you have no idea what you&#x2019;re missing here.&#x201d;</p> <p>I could only hope that one day he&#x2019;d actually talk to me; otherwise, this was going to be a very one-sided relationship. I dusted Cheez-It gunk off my hands and went back to a drawing I&#x2019;d been working on. Since he didn&#x2019;t talk, I had no way of finding out his identity. And in my attempt to avoid eye contact with Naked Dead Man&#x2019;s penis over the last couple of days, I&#x2019;d also avoided several key clues as to said identity. First, he had a long scar that ran from under his left arm, over his rib cage, and down until it ended at his belly button. Whatever had caused it couldn&#x2019;t be pleasant, but it could be vital in identifying him. Second, he had a tattoo on his left biceps that looked very old-school military. It was faded and the ink had spread, but I could still make out an eagle with its talons gripping a United States flag. And third, right underneath his tattoo was a surname, presumably his: ANDRULIS. I&#x2019;d taken out my memo pad and pen and was drawing the tat, since I had yet to find a camera that could photograph the departed.</p> <p>I did my darnedest to draw the tat while simultaneously balancing the Cheez-It box against the gearshift, within arm&#x2019;s reach, and keeping an eye on the Fosters&#x2019; house. Sadly, I sucked at two out of three of those tasks. Mostly at drawing. I&#x2019;d never gotten the hang of it. I failed finger painting in kindergarten, too. That should have been a clue, but I&#x2019;d always wanted to be the next Vermeer or Picasso or, at the very least, the next Clyde Brewster, a boy I&#x2019;d went to school with who drew exploding walls and houses and buildings. No idea why. Alas, my destiny did not lie within the lines of graphite or the strokes of a paintbrush, but at the whim of dead people with PTDD: post-traumatic death disorder.</p> <p>Oh, well. It could have been worse. Clyde Brewster, for example, ended up in prison for trying to blow up a Sack-N-Save. Thankfully, he was better at art than at demolitions. He&#x2019;d asked me out several times, too. #Dodgedabullet.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re not really into baring your soul,&#x201d; I said, eyeing Mr. Andrulis&#x2019;s bare, naked soul, &#x201c;figuratively speaking, but if there&#x2019;s anything you want or need, I&#x2019;m your girl. Mostly because not many people on Earth can see you.&#x201d;</p> <p>I added a shadow on the eagle&#x2019;s face with my blue ink pen, trying to make it look noble. It didn&#x2019;t help. It still looked cross-eyed.</p> <p>&#x201c;And those who can see the departed usually see only a gray mist where you might be. Or they&#x2019;ll feel a rush of cold air when you walk past. But I can see you, touch you, hear you, pretty much anything you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Maybe if I added highlights on its beak, it would look more like an eagle and less like a duck.</p> <p>&#x201c;My name is Charley.&#x201d;</p> <p>But I was using a pen. I couldn&#x2019;t erase. Damn it. I had to think ahead. Real artists thought ahead. I&#x2019;d never get into the Louvre at this rate.</p> <p>&#x201c;Charley Davidson.&#x201d;</p> <p>I tried to scratch off some of the ink, bracing the memo pad against my steering wheel. I tore a tiny hole in the paper instead and cursed under my breath.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the grim reaper,&#x201d; I said from between gritted teeth, &#x201c;but don&#x2019;t let that bother you. It&#x2019;s not as bad as it sounds. I&#x2019;m also a private investigator. That&#x2019;s not as bad as it sounds either. And I shouldn&#x2019;t have given your eagle eyelashes. He looks like Daffy Duck in drag.&#x201d;</p> <p>Giving up, I wrote the name underneath the eagle-ish-type drawing, consoling myself with the fact that abstract art was all the rage before pulling out my phone and snapping a shot of my masterpiece. After angling it this way and that, trying to get the focus just right, I realized the eagle looked better when turned on its side. More masculine. Less&nbsp;&#x2026; water fowl.</p> <p>I saved the best one and deleted the rest as a car pulled up to the Foster house. A nervous thrill rushed up my spine. I put down my pen and memo pad and took a sip of my whipped mocha latte, forcing myself to calm as I waited to see who was driving the gold Prius. I was spying on the Fosters, who lived in a modest neighborhood in the Northeast Heights, because I&#x2019;d been asked to by a friend of mine. She was a special agent with the FBI, like her father before her, and this had been his case, one of the few that went unsolved under his watch. I was trying to help her solve it, though <i>solving</i> might be a strong word. If my hunch was correct, and I liked to think it was, I had insider information that my friend&#x2019;s father was never privy to. Mr. Foster owned an insurance company, and Mrs. Foster ran the office of a local pediatrician. And approximately thirty years ago, their son was taken from them, never to be seen again. I was about 100 percent certain I knew what happened to him.</p> <p>I eased forward and pressed against the steering wheel, angling for a better look at the driver when my aunt Lil&#x2019;s voice wafted toward me from the backseat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the hottie?&#x201d; she asked, her blue hair and floral muumuu solidifying around her as she materialized in my rearview.</p> <p>I tossed a wink over my right shoulder. &#x201c;Hey, Aunt Lil. How was your trip to Bangladesh?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, the food!&#x201d; She waved a hand extravagantly. &#x201c;The people! I was in heaven, I tell ya. Not literally, though.&#x201d; She cackled in delight at her joke.</p> <p>Aunt Lil had died in the &#x2019;60s, a fact she&#x2019;d only recently discovered. So, she couldn&#x2019;t have actually eaten or interacted with the native population. At least, not the living native population. I&#x2019;d never thought about her visiting the departed when she traveled. Now, <i>that</i> would be fascinating.</p> <p>She hitched a thumb toward my newest friend and wriggled her penciled brows. &#x201c;You gonna introduce us?&#x201d;</p> <p>The garage door rose and the driver pulled inside but didn&#x2019;t close the door. It gave me hope. I just wanted a glimpse. A tiny peek.</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not very talkative,&#x201d; I said, squinting for a better view when the driver&#x2019;s-side door opened, &#x201c;but I think his last name is Andrulis. It&#x2019;s on his tattoo.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got some ink?&#x201d; She leaned forward and spotted Mr. A&#x2019;s package. It was hard to miss.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good heavens,&#x201d; she said, her eyes rounding in appreciation.</p> <p>Before I could get a look at the driver, the garage door started closing. &#x201c;Darn,&#x201d; I whispered, tilting my head in unison with the descending door until it completely blocked my view.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d seen a woman&#x2019;s foot as she stepped out of the car before the door closed completely. That was about it.</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly been blessed,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>I laid my head against the steering wheel and expelled a loud breath as disappointment washed over me. I&#x2019;d been handed a file that could hold many answers to the puzzle that was Reyes Alexander Farrow, my nigh fianc�, and the Fosters were a big piece of the puzzle. Their first son had been kidnapped while napping in his room. Because there was never a ransom demand and no witnesses, the trail went cold almost immediately despite a massive search and public pleas from the parents. But the FBI agent assigned to the case never gave up. He&#x2019;d always believed there was more to the case than just a kidnapping. And so did his daughter. We&#x2019;d worked a couple of cases together in the past. She knew about my rep for solving difficult crimes, and she&#x2019;d asked me to look at this cold case that had been the bane of her father&#x2019;s existence.</p> <p>And that was the day that Reyes Farrow&#x2019;s kidnapping fell into my lap. <i>He</i> was the child who had been abducted almost thirty years prior. I glanced down at the file stuffed between my seat and the console. So much potential there. So much heartache.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p> <p>I blinked back to Aunt Lil. &#x201c;Think what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That he&#x2019;s been blessed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, I do.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t help another glance. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s just so&nbsp;&#x2026; there. So unavoidable.&#x201d; I tore my gaze away and pointed to his tat. &#x201c;So, the name Andrulis. Does that ring any bells?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, but I can do some investigating. See what turns up. Speaking of which, I have an idea I want to run past you.&#x201d;</p> <p>I shifted around so I could see her better. &#x201c;Shoot.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think we should work together.&#x201d; She jammed a bony elbow into my side encouragingly, her arm passing through the seat to poke me.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ooooh-kay,&#x201d; I said with a light chuckle.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ha! I knew it was a good idea.&#x201d; Her face brightened, the grayish tones of life after death lightening just a little.</p> <p>It could work. We could be the Dynamic Duo. Only without capes, sadly enough. I&#x2019;d always wanted to do good deeds in a red cape. Or, at the very least, a mauve towel.</p> <p>After taking another sip of my now lukewarm mocha latte&#x2014;which was better than no mocha latte any day of the week&#x2014;I asked, &#x201c;Are you planning to draw a salary?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The way I see it, we should split the take fifty&#x2013;fifty.&#x201d;</p> <p>I stifled a grin. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way you see it, huh?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, and we probably need code names.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her suggestion made me choke on my next sip. &#x201c;Code names?&#x201d; I asked through the coughs.</p> <p>&#x201c;And code phrases like, &#x2018;The sun never sets in the east.&#x2019; That could mean, &#x2018;Switch to plan B.&#x2019; Or it could mean, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s grab a bite to eat before the men come over.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The men?&#x201d; She&#x2019;d really thought this through.</p> <p>&#x201c;Or it could mean, &#x2018;How do you get blood out of silk?&#x2019; Because as PIs, we&#x2019;ll need to know stuff like that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; The file caught my attention again, and I turned back to the Foster house. &#x201c;Blood can be stubborn.&#x201d; Maybe I should just walk up and knock on the door. I could say I was helping a friend with an old case. I could ask if there were any new developments we hadn&#x2019;t been informed of. I could ask if they knew that the man recently released from prison after doing ten years for a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit was their son. I could ask if they knew what he&#x2019;d been through, what he&#x2019;d suffered at the hands of the man who raised him. But what good would adding guilt on top of guilt do anybody?</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you okay, pumpkin cheeks?&#x201d;</p> <p>I shook out of my thoughts. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; well, two hours down the drain, and for what?&#x201d; I gestured toward the Fosters&#x2019; house. &#x201c;A foot in a sensible shoe driving a sensible car.&#x201d;</p> <p>She looked across the street toward the house. &#x201c;What were you hoping to see?&#x201d;</p> <p>Her question took me by surprise. Even I wondered what I was really doing there. Did I simply want to see the woman who might have given birth to the man of my dreams? Did I want a glimpse of the man who may have been his human father?</p> <p>Reyes was the son of Satan, forged in the fires of hell, but he&#x2019;d been born on earth to be with me. To grow up with me. He&#x2019;d done his homework and chose a steady, professional couple to be his human parents. He&#x2019;d planned for us to go to the same schools, shop at the same stores, and eat at the same restaurants. Sadly, even the best-laid plans go awry.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sure, Aunt Lil.&#x201d; What had I been hoping to see? A glimpse of Reyes&#x2019;s past? Of his future? What he would look like in the years to come? Since it had been only a few days since a crazy man tried to kill me, I was trying not to rush terribly headlong into any sit...</p></p><h2>Summer with the Moodys</h2><p>This ship directly from the Titus2 Publishers/Maxwell Family.

His lack of emotion and failure to show remorse only serve to increase his guilt in the eyes of the law, and challenges the fundamental values of society a set of rules so binding that any person breaking them is condemned as an outsider. For Meursault, this is an insult to his reason and a betrayal of his hopes; for Camus it encapsulates the absurdity of life. In &#34;The Outsider&#34; (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the predicament of the individual who refuses to pretend and is prepared to face the indifference of the universe, courageously and alone.</p><p>Albert Camus is the author of a number of best-selling and highly influential works, all of which are published by Penguin. They include THE FALL, THE OUTSIDER and THE FIRST MAN. He is remembered as one of the few writers to have shaped the intellectual climate of post-war France, but beyond that, his fame has been international.

As well as his volumes of poems, which include The Whitsun Weddings and High Windows, he wrote two novels, Jill and A Girl in Winter, and two books of collected journalism: All What Jazz: A Record Diary, and Required Writing: Miscellaneous Prose.

Years later, Raun graduated with a degree in Biomedical Ethics from Brown University and has become a passionate and articulate autism expert and educator with no trace of his former condition. <br>So what happened?</p><p>Thanks to The Son-Rise Program, a revolutionary method created by his parents, Raun experienced a full recovery from autism. (His story was recounted in the best-selling book <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues</i> and in the award-winning NBC television movie <i>Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love</i>.) In <i>Autism Breakthrough,</i> Raun presents the ground-breaking principles behind the program that helped him and thousands of other families with special children. Autism, he explains, is frequently misunderstood as a behavioral disorder when, in fact, it is a social relational disorder. Raun explains what it feels like to be autistic and shows how and why The Son-Rise Program works. <br>A step-by-step guide with clear, practical strategies that readers can apply immediately&#x2015;in some cases, parents see changes in their children in as little as one day&#x2015;<i>Autism Breakthrough</i> makes it possible for these special children to defy their original often-very-limited prognoses. Parents and educators learn how to enable their children to create meaningful, caring relationships, vastly expand their communications, and to participate successfully in the world. </p><p>An important work of hope, science, and progress, <i>Autism Breakthrough</i> presents the powerful ideas and practical applications that have already changed the lives of families all over the world.</p></p><p>Raun K. Kaufman, international lecturer and Director of Global Education of the <i><b>Autism Treatment Center of America</b></i><i><b>&#x2122;</b></i>, has a unique history. As a child, Raun was diagnosed with severe Autism. His parents developed <i><b>The Son-Rise Program</b></i><b><i>�</i></b>, which enabled Raun to completely recover from his Autism with no trace of his former condition. His story was recounted in the book, <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues, </i>and the NBC-TV movie, <i>Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love</i>.

Maybe some were as simple as cuddling with your child or playing peek-a-boo. Perhaps some were as far-reaching as your child&#x2019;s high school graduation or wedding day. <br>But then your child was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. <br>You may have felt that many doors were suddenly closed to the child you love because this diagnosis is often accompanied by a long list of dire predictions. <br>Your child will never talk. <br>Your child will never have friends. <br>Your child will never hold your hand. <br>Your child will never have a job or get married. <br>Perhaps even: your child will never love you. <br>You may have been told to discard many of those hopes and dreams and be &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; in the face of your child&#x2019;s diagnosis. Certainly, there are many, many parents who have heard the pronouncement: &#x201c;Autism is a lifelong condition.&#x201d; <br>No one could fault you for feeling grief-stricken, scared, or even angry. You have just been told all of the things your child will never accomplish&#x2014;as if it had been decided ahead of time. But before reading any further, it is crucial that you understand this: you don&#x2019;t have to accept the limits placed upon your child. <br>Your child has the capacity for learning and communicating, for experiencing real happiness, and developing warm, loving, and satisfying relationships. Your son or daughter can learn to enjoy affection, play a game, and laugh at something silly. He or she can learn to savor the experience of being hugged or held by you. That moment when your child spontaneously looks into your eyes with genuine joy and connection&#x2014;that is something you can have, not just for a fleeting second but on a sustained basis. Do you ever imagine your child playing Little League, joining you on a bike ride, going on a skiing trip with you, playing with other kids at the park, or doing something in the future such as going to college? These events are possible. Children on the autism spectrum are capable of great change, including recovery. <br>Who am I to tell you this? I&#x2019;m someone who&#x2019;s been there&#x2014;not where <i>you</i> are, but where <i>your child</i> is. <br>I used to be autistic. <br>I know, I know. That one&#x2019;s a bit hard to digest. You don&#x2019;t often find &#x201c;used to be&#x201d; and &#x201c;autistic&#x201d; in the same sentence. This is truly unfortunate, because it points to the intense pessimism and utter hopelessness with which autism is viewed by the people doing the diagnosing. Do you know what my chances of recovery were, according the specialists assessing me? <br>Zero percent. <br>That&#x2019;s right: 0%. <br>Here&#x2019;s what happened. <br>MY STORY <br>When I was a young boy, my parents (authors and teachers Barry Neil Kaufman and Samahria Lyte Kaufman) saw that I was developing very differently from my two older sisters. I cried incessantly and inconsolably. When I was picked up, I let my arms dangle loosely at my sides. <br>Before my first birthday, I suffered a severe ear and throat infection, compounded by a violent allergic reaction to the antibiotics prescribed. My life briefly hung in the balance. After a battery of hearing tests, my parents were told that I appeared deaf. As months passed, I seemed increasingly cut off, spiraling ever deeper into my own world. <br>I stopped responding to my name. <br>I ceased making eye contact. <br>I appeared alternately repulsed by and oblivious to the sights and sounds around me. <br>I appeared deaf to a loud noise right next to me and then mesmerized by an almost inaudible whisper in the next room. <br>I lost all interest in other people, but I would remain transfixed by inanimate objects, staring at a pen, a mark on the wall, even my own hands, for long periods of time. <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to be touched or held. <br>I spoke not a word (nor did I cry, yell, point, or do anything to communicate my wishes), displaying a total muteness that stood in sharp contrast to my earlier crying marathons. <br>And then something startling: I became fascinated with the simplest of repetitive activities, spinning plates on their edges for hours on the floor, rocking back and forth, flapping my hands in front of my face. <br>As my condition worsened, my parents raced from specialist to specialist, trying to find out what was wrong. Tests. Tapping pencils. Shaking heads. More tests. (Keep in mind that, in 1973, the year I was born, autism was much less common than it is now, affecting one out of every five thousand children. The latest study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts the incidence of autism at one out of every fifty children.) Soon I was diagnosed as severely autistic. My parents were informed that my IQ was less than 30. <br>What can feel like a devastating diagnosis is not really due to the autism diagnosis itself. The devastation comes primarily from the <i>prognosis</i>&#x2014;all the things parents are told that their child will not do and cannot accomplish. <br>Like many parents today, my parents were told that the prognosis was certain. I would never speak or communicate in any meaningful way. I would never prefer people over objects. I would never emerge from my solitary world and be &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; Moreover, I would never go to college, have a career, or play baseball. I would never fall in love, drive a car, or write a poem. I might, one day, be able to dress myself or eat with utensils, but that was the ceiling of my possibilities. <br>My parents, seeking solutions, were given only grim pronouncements. They searched for a light at the end of the tunnel and were given only dark predictions. Over and over again, it was drilled into my parents&#x2019; heads: autism is a lifelong condition. The specialists explained that, when I got older, my parents would need to look into permanent institutionalization so that I could be properly looked after. <br>I am still astounded at what my mother and father chose to do in the face of such a damning verdict. They didn&#x2019;t believe what they were told. They didn&#x2019;t write me off. Instead, they turned their backs on all the dire prognoses. My parents looked at me and saw possibilities, not deficiencies. Instead of looking at me with fear, they viewed me with wonder. <br>And so they began an experiment. They began by seeking to create an environment where I felt truly safe. They didn&#x2019;t push me. They didn&#x2019;t try to change my behaviors. They sought first to understand me. Think about this for a moment. How often do we really do this&#x2014;with <i>anyone</i>? People behave in ways we don&#x2019;t understand all the time. For most of us, our knee-jerk response is to try to get that person to change&#x2014;whether that person is our partner, our friend, a store clerk, an employee, our parent, or, indeed, our child. When do we ever <i>begin</i> our response by truly seeking to understand without pushing, to provide the other person with an experience of safety and caring without trying to get him or her to change? How amazing that my parents began from this most kind and useful place. <br>Having heard thousands of parents tell me about their experiences with their children&#x2019;s diagnosis and treatment, how they were given a laundry list of things &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; with their child, this description from the opening page of my father&#x2019;s book <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues</i> touches me deeply: <br>His little hands hold the plate delicately as his eyes survey its smooth perimeter. His mouth curls in delight. He is setting the stage. This is his moment, as was the last and each before. This is the beginning of his entry into the solitude that has become his world. Slowly, with a masterful hand, he places the edge of the plate on the floor, sets his body in a comfortable and balanced position, and snaps his wrist with great expertise. The plate begins to spin with dazzling perfection. It revolves on itself as if set in motion by some exacting machine. And it was. <br>This is not an isolated act, not a mere aspect of some childhood fantasy. It is a conscious and delicately skilled activity performed by a very little boy for a very great and expectant audience&#x2014;himself. <br>As the plate moves swiftly, spinning hypnotically on its edge, the little boy bends over it and stares squarely into its motion. Homage to himself, to the plate. For a moment, the boy&#x2019;s body betrays a just perceptible movement similar to the plate&#x2019;s. For a moment, the little boy and his spinning creation become one. His eyes sparkle. He swoons in the playland that is himself. Alive. Alive. <br>Raun Kahlil&#x2014;a little man occupying the edge of the universe. <br>Before this time, this every moment, we had always been in awe of Raun, our notably special child. We sometimes referred to him as &#x201c;brain-blessed.&#x201d; He had always seemed to be riding the high of his own happiness. Highly evolved. Seldom did he cry or utter tones of discomfort. In almost every way, his contentment and solitude seemed to suggest a profound inner peace. He was a seventeen-month-old Buddha contemplating another dimension. <br>A little boy set adrift on the circulation of his own system. Encapsulated behind an invisible but seemingly impenetrable wall. Soon he would be labeled. A tragedy. Unreachable. Bizarre. Statistically, he would fall into a category reserved for all those we see as hopeless&nbsp;&#x2026; unapproachable&nbsp;&#x2026; irreversible. For us the question: could we kiss the ground that others had cursed? <br>Coming from this reverential vantage point, my parents asked themselves what they could do to understand me and my world. The answer began with something that my mother did. She wanted to understand me&#x2014;and also to show me that she accepted me as I was. That I didn&#x2019;t have to change to be loved. <br>So she began to join me in my repetitive, supposedly autistic behaviors. I would sit on the floor and rock&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would rock with me. I would spin a plate on its edge&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would spin her own plate next to mine. I would flap my hands in front of my face&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would flap with me. <br>My parents so respected me that they focused totally on what <i>my</i> experience was&#x2014;not on whether I looked strange or different to other people. <br>Hour after hour&nbsp;&#x2026; day after day&nbsp;&#x2026; month after month, my mother waited. Patiently, my parents waited. <br>Every once in a while, and only while &#x201c;joining,&#x201d; as my parents came to call this true participation in my interests and activities, I glanced at my mother. I smiled at her. I grazed her with the tips of my fingers. <br>And as my parents began to truly understand my world, as they communicated in a thousand different ways, over and over again, that I was safe, that I was loved, that I was accepted, something astonishing happened. A connection began to form. Slowly, carefully, I began to peek out from behind the veil of my special world. Tentatively, I began to join them in theirs. <br>As my mother spent hours upon hours on the floor working with me, she made herself my friend in my world. In so doing, a bond of trust evolved. She cherished and celebrated every look, every smile, every moment of connection for which my parents had waited so long. She cheered me on with every small step. <br>As my relationship with my parents and the world of people strengthened, my mom and dad continued to build an entire program of therapy around me. They helped me to increase my social connection to them and to others, encouraging me to play with them, to look at them, to laugh with them, to take their hands. They constructed interactive games based upon my burgeoning interests, such as animals and airplanes. At every turn, they accomplished this with a deep caring, encouragement, and support&#x2014;never pushing, always inviting. <br>Can you imagine it? They embarked on this experimental journey after hearing nothing but hopeless predictions for me. They continued to reach out to me when I gave them nothing in return. <br>And they persevered in the face of consistent criticism. Learned professionals told my parents that their &#x201c;joining&#x201d; would reinforce and increase my &#x201c;inappropriate autistic behaviors.&#x201d; These professionals chastised my parents for doing the opposite of the behavior modification techniques they recommended&#x2014;and for having &#x201c;false hope,&#x201d; for putting their time into an unproven (and just created) approach that &#x201c;had no hope of succeeding.&#x201d; Family members expressed grave doubts and concerns that my parents were &#x201c;doing their own thing&#x201d; and not leaving my treatment in the hands of professionals who &#x201c;knew best.&#x201d; <br>Remember, too, that, in those days, the world of autism treatment was a barren wasteland. There were no nightly news stories waxing on about the latest treatments or detailing the lives of families with children on the spectrum. There was no Autism Awareness Month. <br>My parents witnessed children being jolted with electric shocks, tied to chairs, placed in dark prison-like rooms, held down&#x2014;and were told that this was progress, the best modern medicine had to offer. <br>To help me, they had to walk in the opposite direction, alone. Without any support, they supported me. They worked and waited. They persisted and persevered. Not knowing what the future held, not requiring my reciprocation of their love, care, smiles, and cheers, they gave me every chance. <br>For three and a half years, they worked with me, painstakingly building a bridge from my world to theirs. <br>And it all paid off. <br>I recovered completely from my autism without any trace of my former condition. (Go to www.autismbreakthrough.com/chapter1 to see some childhood photos of me and my parents.) The years of work, the late nights, the persevering in the face of ongoing criticism, the love and dedication&#x2014;it bore the kind of fruit it was never supposed to bear. It produced the outcome it was never supposed to produce. And I&#x2019;ve lived the life I was never supposed to live. <br>THE CREATION OF THE AUTISM TREATMENT CENTER OF AMERICA <br>My parents developed this innovative, home-based, child-centered autism treatment program because of their very personal experiences entering my world. At the same time, the method they created was based upon what autism actually is&#x2014;a difficulty connecting and bonding with others&#x2014;rather than how autism is typically treated&#x2014;as a problem of inappropriate behavior that must be extinguished, altered, and retrained. <br>They called their approach The Son-Rise Program. <br>There were several factors that made their approach unique. First, it was created by parents. That alone was a gigantic departure from the doctor/professional/lab-created norm. Second, my parents began with the premise that children on the autism spectrum are capable of limitless growth. Third, they started by joining me in my world rather than forcing me to conform to theirs. Fourth, they used motivation, rather than repetition, as the doorway to learning. Moreover, they focused on having a nonjudgmental and welcoming attitude with me, seeing that my responsiveness was largely dependent on the attitudes and emotions of the people working with me. And, finally, unlike every other treatment they saw, my parents prioritized human interaction over academics and tasks such as naming colors, adding numbers, and brushing teeth. <br>But until my recovery was complete, none of these concepts had spread beyond the walls of our house. Until my father wrote a book about it. <br>Shortly after my recovery in the late 1970s, my father wrote a best-selling book recounting our story entitled <i>Son-Rise</i>&#x2014;now updated as <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues</i>. (My father has wri...</p><h2>Genghis Khan: His Conquests, His Empire, His Legacy</h2><p><b>A definitive and sweeping account of the life and times of the world's greatest conqueror--Genghis Khan--and the rise of the Mongol empire in the 13th century</b><b><br></b>Combining fast-paced accounts of battles with rich cultural background and the latest scholarship, Frank McLynn brings vividly to life the strange world of the Mongols and Genghis Khan's rise from boyhood outcast to world conqueror.

Such a legend has accrued to this movement that the story of the SI now demands to be told in a contemporary voice capable of putting it into the context of twenty-first-century struggles. McKenzie Wark delves into the Situationists unacknowledged diversity, revealing a world as rich in practice as it is in theory. Tracing the group&#39;s development from the bohemian Paris of the 50s to the explosive days of May 68, Wark&#39;s take on the Situationists is biographically and historically rich, presenting the group as an ensemble creation, rather than the brainchild and dominion of its most famous member, Guy Debord. Roaming through Europe and the lives of those who made up the movement including Constant, Asger Jorn, Mich�le Bernstein, Alex Trocchi and Jacqueline De Jong Wark uncovers an international movement riven with conflicting passions. Accessible to those who have only just discovered the Situationists and filled with new insights, The Beach Beneath the Street rereads the group s history in the light of our contemporary experience of communications, architecture, and everyday life. The Situationists tried to escape the world of twentieth-century spectacle and failed in the attempt. Wark argues that they may still help us to escape the twenty-first century, while we still can.</p><p>&#x201c;Wark is a marvellous guide to the micro-society of the Situationists ... He brings to the task a necessary sympathy, an encyclopedic knowledge, and a certain stylistic irrepressibility.&#x201d; &#x2013; Alex Danchev, Times Literary Supplement<br><br>&#x201c;Wark is a fine aphorist ...

[a] brilliant account ... an essential work for our own times.&#x201d; &#x2013; John Burnside, Times Literary Supplement, Books of the Year<br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2013; Jonathan Derbyshire, Guardian<br><br>&#x201c;The book I read three times back to back was McKenzie Wark&#x2019;s brilliant study of the Situationists&#x201d; &#x2013; John Burnside, Scotsman, Books of the Year<br><br>&#x201c;This is no ordinary history. Instead, &#x2018;it&#x2019;s a question of retrieving a past specific to the demands of the present.&#x2019; The Beach Beneath the Street rereads that past in a way that prefers not to smooth out its messier edges, refuses to reify (to pick up the jargon) what made it radical, what still makes it relevant.&#x201d; &#x2013; David Winters, Bookslut<br><br>&#x201c;Covering the SI&#x2019;s adventures in philosophy, art, architecture, literature and cinema (and suggesting that we should do away with many of the distinctions between these categories), Wark traces a lineage we have apparently lost.. The author&#x2019;s primary proposal is that although we live in serious times we should still have fun with time. We should treat history as a user&#x2019;s manual. This history of the SI shifts with gay abandon between past, present and future tenses, and constantly rattles the boundaries.&#x201d; &#x2013; Mark Rappolt, Art Review<br><br>&#x201c;In an alienated, all too knowing world absent of God, art and revolution, Wark&#x2019;s book dares us to keep our spirits up, asking us to think about how to maintain creative resistance, how to keep fidelity with some detourn�ed idea of the Marxist and Situationist past, and, following their goal of ideas in action, how best to practise our passionate &#x2018;solidarity without faith.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2013; Kate Webb, Camden New Journal<br><br>&#x201c;Wark&#x2019;s history is timely ... with the age of austerity promising more trouble, the Situationists, those alienated prophets of the media age, still tout the most adventurous analysis of 21st-century life &#x2013; and what happens next.&#x201d; &#x2013; Colin Waters, Herald Scotland<br><br>&#x201c;McKenzie Wark&#x2019;s engaging narrative could not have come at a better time &#x2013; last week&#x2019;s riots demonstrated tragically the profound alienation, even despair, of swathes of urban poor and destitute and minorities&#x2019; worrying descent into hellish criminality.&#x201d; &#x2013; Morning Star<br><br>&#x201c;One of the best aspects of his pithy, often self-consciously lapidary, book is his intriguing investigation of some of the byways of Situationist historiography ... . the Situationists&#x2019; attitude towards intellectual property is hugely relevant in an era when digital reproduction has dragged information towards the &#x2018;free&#x2019; model, and Wark addresses this well in sections on the implications of d�tournement&#x2014;the re-use and modification of fragments of already existing texts and images in the creation of new works&#x2014;for political practice.&#x201d; &#x2013; Karl Whitney, 3:AM Magazine<br><br>&#x201c;What sets Wark&#x2019;s book apart from those many other failed histories is in its resistance to merely telling the easy story. The familiar watchwords of the SI &#x2013; d�rive, detourn�ment, potlatch &#x2013; appear as one would expect, but Wark presents them as breathing, charged ideas, not some dead terms once again dusted off and rehashed. When we relegate events to pure history we rob moments, situations, of their power to change. We turn specifics into constants, tactics into rules, and ultimately render radical gestures impotent. Wark wants to give these moments a different history: to show that those theories and practices of the Situationist International aren&#x2019;t done with us yet.&#x201d; &#x2013; Matthew McKenzie, MaximumRocknRollMcKenzie Wark is the author of A Hacker Manifesto, Gamer Theory, The Beach Beneath the Street, and The Spectacle of Disintegration.

McKillip</b> is the award-winning author of numerous novels.McKillip&#x2019;s latest is an elegantly written alternate-worlds tale set in Sealey Head, a small ocean-side town that exists in two worlds, in both of which a bell peals as the sun sets. The magnificent Aislinn House is the focal point, a domicile whose doors sometimes open to rooms in a castle in which the young princess Ysabo is among the females sworn to carry out rigid, unexplainable rituals to keep the world from coming to an end. This-world events are having a devastating effect on the other Sealey Head. While carrying out her duties, Emma, housemaid at Aislinn House, frequently finds herself peering into the other world. She comes to know Ysabo, but neither can cross into the other&#x2019;s world. Meanwhile, the bell has haunted Gwyneth as long as she can remember, and she writes stories that look at possible explanations for the mystery of the bell, which no one can see. McKillip&#x2019;s knack for vividly portrayed characters and fairy-tale ambience is evident in a story that includes some appealing romance and humor. --Sally Estes</p><h2>Tales of the Menehune</h2><p>These legends have been selected with the thought that, in length and content, they are suitable to be told or read to young children as well as to be read by older ones. Some are very old legends, common to many Pacific islands, and others are of recent origin. The menehune were the little people of Hawaiian tales. As they lived in the mountain forests and only came to the lowland at night, they were not often seen. Yet the Hawaiians could describe them. They were 2 or 3 feet tall, the stories said, thickset and hairy. Some of them were never heard to talk while others talked with deep, gruff voices. The Hawaiians said their talk sounded like the low growl of a dog, and their laughter could be heard far away. The mu, a banana-eating people, were a tribe of the menehune.</p><p></p><h2>Standing in a River Waving a Stick</h2><p>&#34;The solution to any problem-- work, love, money, whatever -- is to go fishing, and the worse the problem, the longer the trip should be.&#34; This is John Gierach&#39;s perspective on fishing and life, and it isn&#39;t entirely tongue-in-cheek. But Gierach knows that there is more to fishing than actually catching fish, or as he puts it, &#34;The real lessons of fishing are the ones that come after you&#39;ve caught some fish. They have to do with things like solitude, quietude, patience, perspective, humor, and the sublime coffee break.&#34; In Standing in a River Waving a Stick, Gierach addresses all these and more with his trademark combination of wit and wisdom. In this new book, Gierach visits his favorite trout-filled waters, from the Colorado foothills to British Columbia and points between, recounting both memorable fishing spots and memorable fish. He discusses such topics as the differences between fishing in ponds and fishing in streams; what makes a good fly pattern (&#34;The good ones are the ones that work...and the great ones are those that survive beyond their own generation&#34;); the ethics of writing about undiscovered trout waters; and the fly-fisher&#39;s progression from Stage One -- &#34;when you fish from dawn to dusk without a break, get quickly drunk on something cheap, [and] spend the night wrapped in a wet blanket&#34; -- to something slightly more civilized. Gierach takes in his surroundings with the keen and appreciative eye of a naturalist, whether he&#39;s observing the hatching patterns of flies, catching subtle clues to the presence of potentially big fish nearby, or taking note of the local denizens in his wry and philosophical way (&#34;Rural people understand that life is basically a dangerous, unmanageable mess, so when things go wrong, their suspicions are confirmed and it&#39;s just a blessing no one was killed&#34;). Above all, however, Gierach is an example of his own assertion that good fishermen have &#34;the uncanny ability to immediately turn any conversation to angling with a fly rod, on the theory that the essence of anything is in how it&#39;s either like or unlike fishing.&#34; Rich in fishing lore, humor, and the seasoned know-how that has won him a devoted readership, Standing in a River Waving a Stick is sure to delight fly-fishers</p><p>John Gierach, America's favorite trout bum and author of such wise and humorous collections as <i>Dances with Trout</i> and <i>Sex, Death, and Fly-Fishing</i>, sets this volume in motion by testing the waters of the philosophical stream: "Lately," he ponders, "I've been thinking about what makes a good fly-fisher, possibly the last fair question of the twentieth century that might actually have an answer." In searching for that answer, he naturally begins to spin his reels, firm in the belief that the solution to any question or problem is to go fishing, "and the worse the problem, the longer the trip should be."<p> Of course, Gierach's life is one extended fishing trip, so he sets out for pools and streams from Montana and Michigan to British Columbia and his own Colorado, musing along the way on subsets of that last fair question like technique versus inner grace, the number of fish you actually catch, the stories you come home with, and the company you choose to cast your lot--and flies--with. As expected with Gierach, the essays of this spirited array are less answers in themselves than provocatively enjoyable journeys through a richly literate and detailed landscape of interesting bugs (the chapter called "Boatmen"), obsessions ("Getting Stuck"), local streams ("Taking It Personally"), and even a memorial service held off until the fish were biting ("Jordan River"). In the end, Gierach is left where he began, "certain that on the day I become a truly sublime fly-fisher, all my failings will be overshadowed and all my demons will swim under rocks and stay there until I go away." Until that day comes, he'll just have to take solace from the way he continues to hook us pleasurably on the natural resources of his own prose. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><b>John Gierach</b> is the author of several previous books, most recently <i>Another Lousy Day in Paradise.</i> His work has appeared in <i>Field &amp; Stream, Fly Fisherman,</i> and <i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel,</i> among other publications.

The longer &#x201c;Recessional&#x201d; examines the place of time in writing&#x2014;how writing makes a new time of its own, a time apart from institutional time&#x2014;while the startling &#x201c;Nothing Will Have Taken Place&#x201d; moves from Mallarm� and Don DeLillo to the ball mastery of Zidane to look at how art, whether that of a poet, novelist, or athlete, destroys given codes of meaning and behavior, returning them to play. Certain points of reference recur with dreamlike insistence&#x2014;among them the artist Ed Ruscha&#x2019;s <i>Royal Road Test</i>, a photographic documentation of the roadside debris of a Royal typewriter hurled from the window of a traveling car; the great blooms of jellyfish that are filling the oceans and gumming up the machinery of commerce and military domination&#x2014;and the question throughout is: How can art explode the restraining conventions of so-called realism, whether aesthetic or political, to engage in the active reinvention of the world?</p><p><b>Tom McCarthy</b>'s work has been translated into more than twenty languages His previous books include <i>Remainder</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>Satin Island</i>, and <i>Tintin and the Secret of Literature</i>.

She was an ardent follower of Hahnemann&#39;s teaching. First published in the 1930s, this book provides case histories by Dr Dorothy Shepherd. She discusses various homeopathic remedies and cures she used on patients, and the effects they had on overall health. Dr Dorothy Shepherd had wide experience both in clinics of Harley Street and in the poorer parts of London. Although she had leanings towards homoeopathy during her student years, it was not until she visited Dr J.T.Kent in USA and experienced great benefit from this therapy that she fully adopted this method of treatment in her practice. Having embarked upon a career as a homeopath, she studied the subject deeply and the more she learned the more she became convinced that it is the finest method of dealing with every type of ailment. Being a true healer she believed that every sufferer should know of homeopathy and in order to make it more widely known she began writing a much acclaimed series of books, the best known of which is Magic of the Minimum Dose and this book, More Magic of the Minimum Dose.</p><p></p><h2>Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy (Politics and Society in Modern America, 7)</h2><p><p>In 1958, an African-American handyman named Jimmy Wilson was sentenced to die in Alabama for stealing two dollars. Shocking as this sentence was, it was overturned only after intense international attention and the interference of an embarrassed John Foster Dulles. Soon after the United States' segregated military defeated a racist regime in World War II, American racism was a major concern of U.S. allies, a chief Soviet propaganda theme, and an obstacle to American Cold War goals throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Each lynching harmed foreign relations, and "the Negro problem" became a central issue in every administration from Truman to Johnson.</p><br><p>In what may be the best analysis of how international relations affected any domestic issue, Mary Dudziak interprets postwar civil rights as a Cold War feature. She argues that the Cold War helped facilitate key social reforms, including desegregation. Civil rights activists gained tremendous advantage as the government sought to polish its international image. But improving the nation's reputation did not always require real change. This focus on image rather than substance--combined with constraints on McCarthy-era political activism and the triumph of law-and-order rhetoric--limited the nature and extent of progress.</p><br><p>Archival information, much of it newly available, supports Dudziak's argument that civil rights was Cold War policy. But the story is also one of people: an African-American veteran of World War II lynched in Georgia; an attorney general flooded by civil rights petitions from abroad; the teenagers who desegregated Little Rock's Central High; African diplomats denied restaurant service; black artists living in Europe and supporting the civil rights movement from overseas; conservative politicians viewing desegregation as a communist plot; and civil rights leaders who saw their struggle eclipsed by Vietnam.</p><br><p>Never before has any scholar so directly connected civil rights and the Cold War. Contributing mightily to our understanding of both, Dudziak advances--in clear and lively prose--a new wave of scholarship that corrects isolationist tendencies in American history by applying an international perspective to domestic affairs.</p></p><p><br><p>"Meticulously researched and beautifully written, Mary Dudziak's book makes a spectacularly illuminating contribution to a subject traditionally neglected--the linkage between race relations and foreign policy: neither African-American history nor diplomatic history will be the same again."<b>--Gerald Horne, author of <i>Race Woman: The Lives of Shirley Graham Du Bois</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"Reinhold Niebuhr once commented that blacks cannot count on the altruism of whites for improvements in blacks' condition. Readers who think Niebuhr's remark was unfair to whites need to read this book. Mary Dudziak documents, in impressive detail, how the self-interest of elite whites instigated, shaped, and limited civil rights gains for blacks during the Cold War years. Raises serious questions about the future of racial justice in America."<b>--Richard Delgado, Jean Lindsley Professor of Law, University of Colorado</b><br></p><br><p>"This book is a <i>tour de force</i>. Dudziak's brilliant analysis shows that the Cold War had a profound impact on the civil rights movement. Hers is the first book to make this important connection. It is a major contribution to our understanding of both the Civil Rights movement and the Cold War itself. . . . Because it is beautifully written in clear, lively prose, and draws its analysis from dramatic events and compelling stories of people involved from the top level of government to the grass roots, it will be an outstanding book for both students and the general public. I recommend it with no hesitation and with great enthusiasm."<b>--Elaine Tyler May, author of<i>Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This book reflects a growing interest among historians in the global significance of race. . . .

Within weeks, more than 300,000 Chinese civilians were systematically raped, tortured, and murdered?a death toll exceeding that of the atomic blasts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Using extensive interviews with survivors and newly discovered documents, Iris Chang has written what will surely be the definitive history of this horrifying episode. <i>The Rape of Nanking</i> tells the story from three perspectives: of the Japanese soldiers who performed it, of the Chinese civilians who endured it, and of a group of Europeans and Americans who refused to abandon the city and were able to create a safety zone that saved almost 300,000 Chinese. Among these was the Nazi John Rabe, an unlikely hero whom Chang calls the "Oskar Schindler of China" and who worked tirelessly to protect the innocent and publicize the horror. More than just narrating the details of an orgy of violence, <i>The Rape of Nanking</i> analyzes the militaristic culture that fostered in the Japanese soldiers a total disregard for human life. Finally, it tells the appalling story: about how the advent of the Cold War led to a concerted effort on the part of the West and even the Chinese to stifle open discussion of this atrocity. Indeed, Chang characterizes this conspiracy of silence, that persists to this day, as "a second rape."</p><p>China has endured much hardship in its history, as Iris Chang shows in her ably researched <i>The Rape of Nanking</i>, a book that recounts the horrible events in that eastern Chinese city under Japanese occupation in the late 1930s. Nanking, she writes, served as a kind of laboratory in which Japanese soldiers were taught to slaughter unarmed, unresisting civilians, as they would later do throughout Asia. Likening their victims to insects and animals, the Japanese commanders orchestrated a campaign in which several hundred thousand--no one is sure just how many--Chinese soldiers and noncombatants alike were killed. Chang turns up an unlikely hero in German businessman John Rabe, a devoted member of the Nazi party who importuned Adolf Hitler to intervene and stop the slaughter, and who personally saved the lives of countless residents of Nanking. She also suggests that the Japanese government pay reparations and apologize for its army's horrific acts of 60 years ago.<p><strong>Iris Chang</strong> was a journalism graduate of the University of Illinoisat Urbana, and she worked as a reporter for the Associated Press and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> before winning a graduate fellowship to the writing seminars program at Johns Hopkins University.

Life and Fate eclipse almost all that passes for serious fiction in the West today&#34;.--George Steiner.</p><p>Suppressed by the KGB, Life and Fate is a rich and vivid account of what the Second World War meant to the Soviet Union. <br>On its completion in 1960, Life and Fate was suppressed by the KGB. Twenty years later, the novel was smuggled out of the Soviet Union on microfilm. At the centre of this epic novel looms the battle of Stalingrad. Within a world torn apart by ideological tyranny and war, Grossman's characters must work out their destinies. Chief among these are the members of the Shaposhnikov family - Lyudmila, a mother destroyed by grief for her dead son; Viktor, her scientist-husband who falls victim to anti-semitism; and Yevgenia, forced to choose between her love for the courageous tank-commander Novikov and her duty to her former husband. Life and Fate is one of the great Russian novels of the 20th century, and the richest and most vivid account there is of what the Second World War meant to the Soviet Union.Vasily Grossman was born in 1905 in the Ukraine. During the Second World War he worked on the Red Star and was the first journalist in any language to report on the death camps. A year after completion of <b>Life and Fate</b>, KGB agents arrived at his house with orders to confiscate the manuscript. However, a microfilm copy of the manuscript found its way to the West in the hands of Vladimir Voinovich. Vasily Grossman died in 1964.</p><h2>Beyond the Blue Event Horizon: (#2)</h2><p>In Book Two of the Heechee Saga, Robinette Broadhead is on his way to making a fortune by bankrolling an expedition to the Food Factory--a Heechee spaceship that can graze the cometary cloud and transfor the basic elements of the universe into untold quantities of food.

These traditions have survived political persecution and upheaval thanks to the efforts of a handful of dedicated lamas such as B�n lineage holder Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. The B�n healing tradition invokes The Five Warrior Syllables - &#34;seed&#34; sounds that bring us to the essential nature of mind and release the boundless creativity and positive qualities that are fundamental to our natural consciousness. Through the medicine of sound, practitioners learn to clear obstacles on the level of the body, the energetic and emotional dimensions of being, and the spiritual consciousness. Through this integrated book and CD learning program, Tenzin Rinpoche gives users the tools to access wisdom and compassion and use the vibration of sacred sound to cultivate the healing power within the body&#39;s subtle channels. Lama and B�n meditation master Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche is renowned for his gift of rendering ancient texts in a warm and clear way to his Western readers. With Tibetan Sound Healing, he reveals the secrets of B�n sacred syllables and invites us to join him in sound to purify the body, connect with our inherent perfection and completeness, and to awaken spiritual virtue.</p><p>Tenzin Wangyal Rinopche is one of the few Bon masters living in the West and his 15 years with Western practitioners is evident in his skill as a teacher. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><h2>Serpent Gate</h2><p>After receiving a call from the newly appointed chief of the New Mexico State Police, ex-Santa Fe chief of detectives Kevin Kerney is thrown into an investigation of a small-town cop-killing no one has been able to solve. His only lead: a homeless schizophrenic's ramblings about rape and an uncharted place called Serpent Gate. <p> Meanwhile, back in Santa Fe, priceless art is stolen from the governor's offices and a beautiful young blonde is murdered in a millionaire's mansion. Kerney follows a trail of clues to Mexico, where he faces off against an old nemesis with powerful government connections. Unwilling to back down, Kerney must use all of his tenacity, raw courage, and knowledge of the criminal mind in a bloody showdown that may cost him his life.</p></p><p>You can smell and feel the crisp air of New Mexico as you read Michael McGarrity's books about would-be rancher and occasional lawman Kevin Kerney, which real- life ex-Santa Fe County deputy sheriff McGarrity fills with his expertise and talent. Like its predecessors--<i>Tularosa</i> and <i>Mexican Hat</i>, available in paperback--this third Kerney story centers on an iconic piece of land. At first Kerney thinks that Serpent Gate exists only in the mind of seriously schizophrenic Robert Cordova, the sole witness to the murder of a small-town policeman. But Cordova's obsessions with rape and murder turn out to have strong links to the real world. Another story thread brings Kerney back to work in Santa Fe, where the obsessions--expensive art, crooked politics, and high-profile crime--are sleeker but no less deadly. <i>-- Dick Adler</i><b>Michael McGarrity</b> is the author of the Kevin Kerney mystery novels including <i>Tularosa,</i> nominated for an Anthony Award; <i>Mexican Hat;</i> and <i>Serpent Gate.</i> A former Santa Fe County deputy sheriff, he also served as an instructor at the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy and as an investigator for the New Mexico Public Defender&#x2019;s Office.

What began as a personal safari to unearth her authentic self, transformed into her number-one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy,</i> and <i>Something More: Excavating your Authentic Self.</i> Sarah Ban Breathnach is the publisher of The Simple Abundance Press, a groundbreaking joint venture with Scribner, and the founder of The Simple Abundance Charitable Fund.Before the author's bestseller SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, she wrote this charming little book of domestic advice. Presented by the fictitious Victorianna Sharp, it contains gentle practices compiled from an old trunk of Victorian era magazines she discovered. Though controversy will continue about who's responsible for the home, the program does a good job of not assuming it's the mom. Anyone, including stay-at-home or working dads, can take some initiative in setting up the traditions. This is a short program (only a small range of actual traditions is mentioned), so most of its energy is spent promoting the idea of someone initiating the rituals and routines she recommends. For discombobulated families everywhere, a worthwhile audio with some charming ideas.

He was a Rhodes Scholar and a Yale Law School graduate, but he was also a fatherless child from rural Arkansas. He was one of the most talented politicians of his age, but he inspired enmity of such intensity that his opponents would stop at nothing to destroy him. He was the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to win two successive presidential elections, but he was also the first president since Andrew Johnson to be impeached.</p><p> In this incisive biography of America&#x2019;s forty-second president, Michael Tomasky examines Clinton&#x2019;s eight years in office, a time often described as one of peace and prosperity, but in reality a time of social and political upheaval, as the culture wars grew ever more intense amid the rise of the Internet (and with it, online journalism and blogging); military actions in Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo; standoffs at Waco and Ruby Ridge; domestic terrorism in Oklahoma City; and the rise of al-Qaeda. It was a time when Republicans took control of Congress and a land deal gone bad turned into a constitutional crisis, as lurid details of a sitting president&#x2019;s sexual activities became the focus of public debate.</p><p> Tomasky&#x2019;s clear-eyed assessment of Clinton&#x2019;s presidency offers a new perspective on what happened, what it all meant, and what aspects continue to define American politics to this day. In many ways, we are still living in the Age of Clinton.</p></p><p><b>Michael Tomasky </b>is a special correspondent for <i>The Daily Beast</i> and the editor in chief of <i>Democracy</i>, as well as a regular contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. He was previously executive editor of <i>The American Prospect</i> and the founding editor of <i>Guardian America</i>. He is the author of <i>Left for Dead: The Life, Death, and Possible Resurrection of Progressive Politics in America</i> and <i>Hillary&#x2019;s Turn: Inside Her Improbable, Victorious Senate Campaign</i>. He lives outside Washington, D. C.Reviewed with Bill Thompson and Dorcas Thompson's <i>George W. Bush</i>.<p>Gr. 4-8. These short, lively volumes from the new Childhoods of the Presidents series focus on boyhood experiences that help explain how and why each man came to be the kind of leader he is. The purpose, according to the series introduction, is to help all young people aspire to great success, no matter what their background. In Marcovitz's book, the focus is on Clinton's charismatic charm, his compassion for African Americans struggling for civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s, and on the pivotal encounter when he stood up to his abusive, alcoholic stepfather. Thompson's title highlights Bush's fun-loving appeal, his childhood of financial privilege, his formative role as the eldest son of a politician, and his crucial experience helping his mother cope with the loss of "Georgie's" sister to leukemia. Filled with colorful photos and interesting sidebars, both books humanize their subjects, and the emphasis on character and family relations will help young readers see very approachable qualities in the powerful leaders. <i>Roger Leslie</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It continues to explore the intersections of nature, human experience, and the teachings of time.<br>In the mix of inspiring text and fine photography, Dr. Flynn again is able to communicate the powerful lessons learned in his many years as a trauma psychologist. His life's work has taken him to the locations of some of the country's most tragic events--events such as the shootings at Columbine High School, numerous hurricanes, floods, and fires, the bombings in Oklahoma City, and the attacks of 9/11. In the unique format of The Voices of Stone, Flynn shares with us the lessons learned from decades of being with individuals, families, and communities in their darkest hours. The stones give voice to his wisdom as they speak to all of us.<br>The Voices of Stones is a unique and compelling journey. In its pages we follow an old man returning to walk stone beaches while we listen in on his dialogue with the stones that cover those beaches. These are not frivolous conversations. The old man asks the stones to speak to him about the pain of loss and the search for hope. In this dialogue the old man finds hope and gains new perspective on the world and his place in it.<br>This book will resonate with those who face loss of all types. They will be reminded that they are not alone and that recovery and hope is possible.<br><br>"<br><br></p><p>Multiple award-winning photographer and psychologist, Brian Flynn, is the former Rear Admiral/Assistant Surgeon General in the U.S. Public Health Service.

What does prove surprising is that, in his first book for children, Breathed achieves just the right balance of sweetness and levity. This is definitely not an adult book thinly disguised as a children's book, but a work that little ones will love for its own magic and logic, and for Opus's final, well-deserved triumph. It's Christmastime, and Opus, wearing his customary red bow tie and his seasonal red cap, bemoans the fact that he is a bird that can't fly: "I might as well have been born a snail. Or a slice of melba toast." He sends a heartfelt letter to Santa, and on Christmas Eve, Opus gets a chance to earn his wings. The deliciously satisfying conclusion perfectly captures the spirit of Christmas, and Breathed's art is an entrancing mix of comic-book sketchiness and full-color, full-blown scenes that rival the very best of Disney. Not many books fit the bill as treats for "children of all ages," but this one could top the list. All ages. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Levant Trilogy (Fortunes of War)</h2><p>As the British fight a desperate battle against the German forces in Egypt, Guy and Harriet Pringle are involved in their personal struggle with their marriage</p><p>Olivia Manning was the author of more than twelve novels including The Balkan Trilogy, The Doves of Venus, The Playroom and The Remarkable Expedition.

Radical environmentalists used direct action, from blockades and tree-sits to industrial sabotage, to save a wild nature that they believed to be in a state of crisis. Questioning the premises of liberal humanism, they subscribed to an ecocentric philosophy that attributed as much value to nature as to people. Although critics dismissed them as marginal, radicals posed a vital question that mainstream groups too often ignored: Is environmentalism a matter of common sense or a fundamental critique of the modern world?<br><br>In <i>The Ecocentrists</i>, Keith Makoto Woodhouse offers a nuanced history of radical environmental thought and action in the late-twentieth-century United States. Focusing especially on the group Earth First!, Woodhouse explores how radical environmentalism responded to both postwar affluence and a growing sense of physical limits. While radicals challenged the material and philosophical basis of industrial civilization, they glossed over the ways economic inequality and social difference defined people&#x2019;s different relationships to the nonhuman world. Woodhouse discusses how such views increasingly set Earth First! at odds with movements focused on social justice and examines the implications of ecocentrism&#x2019;s sweeping critique of human society for the future of environmental protection. A groundbreaking intellectual history of environmental politics in the United States, <i>The Ecocentrists</i> is a timely study that considers humanism and individualism in an environmental age and makes a case for skepticism and doubt in environmental thought.</p><p>Keith Makoto Woodhouse is an assistant professor at Northwestern University, where he teaches in the History Department and the Environmental Policy and Culture Program.Woodhouse deftly brings together the intellectual history of the many threads of American environmentalism with the thinkers, the activists, the organizations, and the issues that have charged environmental politics since the 1960s. Required reading for anyone with a serious interest in the history of environmental activism and thought. (James Morton Turner, Wellesley College)<br><br>This book is a profound achievement. In <i>The Ecocentrists</i>, Keith Woodhouse examines ecocentrism within and up against traditions of radical American protest, politics, and action. Deepening our understanding of radical environmentalism well beyond any previous study, the book lays to rest caricature and misinformation. Each chapter&#x2015;each page&#x2015;will make you think hard. (William Deverell, University of Southern California)<br><br>A compelling story about the enigmatic journey of environmentalism since the 1960s, <i>The Ecocentrists</i> shines a bright light on the radical potential and heartbreaking pitfalls of Americans&#x2019; ecological crusades. Highlighting the historic and contemporary tensions within the environmental movement between localism and globalism, populism and elitism, freedom and limits, and humanism and misanthropy, Woodhouse provides essential reading for anyone interested in thinking through how efforts to create a healthier planet can be made as just and humane as possible. (Darren Frederick Speece, author of <i>Defending Giants: The Redwood Wars and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics</i>)<br><br><i>The Ecocentrists </i>captures eloquently the human stories of those who stood up for the nonhuman world.

Nevertheless, it has exerted a more powerful hold on international popular music than any nation besides England and America. From Prince Buster to Burning Spear, Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry to Yellowman, Bob Marley to Shabba Ranks, reggae music is one of the most dynamic and powerful musical forms of the twentieth century. And, as Lloyd Bradley shows in his deft, definitive, and always entertaining book, it is and always has been the people&#39;s music. Born in the sound systems of the Kingston slums, reggae was the first music poor Jamaicans could call their own, and as it spread throughout the world, it always remained fluid, challenging, and distinctly Jamaican. Based on six years of research -- original interviews with most of reggae&#39;s key producers, musicians, and international players -- and a lifelong enthusiasm for one of the most remarkable of the world&#39;s musics, This Is Reggae Music is the definitive history of reggae.</p><p>With flair, skill, passion and stamina, Bradley (Reggae on CD) fluidly traces Jamaican music's odyssey from the pure energy of 1950s Kingston's open-air sound system scene to the eruption of homegrown ska, the "smooove of Rocksteady," reggae's depth; holding his nose for digital/ragga/ roughneck, he regains optimism for the emergent new roots genre. But the meat lies in how Jamaica's poverty, societal strife and "politricks," tempered by the creativity, spirituality and upbeatness of its people, yielded the music, which for better and worse reached the U.K., the U.S. and beyond. Born in London to Jamaican immigrants, Bradley spent six years studying his subject. Avoiding the who/what/ when tedium that encumbers many music histories, he reveals the whys and hows. The legendary Prince Buster whets readers appetites in the foreword, then passes the mike to Bradley. Hardly a ham, Bradley passes it often to the originators and major players (including Lee "Scratch" Perry, Big Youth, Burning Spear) for lengthy, lively quotes and anecdotes. He pays scholarly attention to musical detail and attempts to highlight everyone who has made reggae waves, not just the stars. He writes, "It's a brave publisher that will put out a volume about reggae in general without its jacket artwork conspicuously featuring Bob Marley's face." And a brave writer who forestalls addressing the master's impact until the 17th chapter. "For many, Marley is reggae"; but it's a "colossal irony that, during his tenure at the top, reggae's most famous exponent exerted practically no influence over the music's development at grassroots i.e., Kingston studios level." Such insider-expert revelations will delight reggae's many devotees. Agent, Sophie Brewer, Penguin UK. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>For most casual listeners, reggae music can be reduced to one artist Bob Marley. This book, however, proves in exhaustive detail that there is greater breadth and depth to the 40-year-old art form. Bradley, who ran his own sound system for reggae dances in the late 1970s and has written for many British music periodicals, is well qualified to present a history of this scope. In a witty and engaging manner, he traces the development of the genre from mento to sound system dances, ska, rock steady, reggae, dub, toasting, (precursor to American rap), and many other offshoots. He also provides comprehensive and incisive histories of the Jamaican and British cultures and societies (touching on many Rastafarian influences) that acted as catalysts for the development of the music. Readers who want to learn about Marley are still best served by Timothy White's Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley (LJ 6/15/83; Owl Bks., 1998. rev. ed.). But for enthusiasts, this book is fabulous, on a par with Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen's Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music (Temple Univ., 1998). Highly recommended for large public or academic libraries. Bill Walker, Stockton-San Joaquin Cty.

For longtime Rebus fans, it is an opportunity to follow him as he explores a subplot from his most recent outing, Dead Souls. When his high-school sweetheart calls him out of the blue, Rebus agrees to track down her missing son, who was last seen at a bar owned by some shady mob-linked gangsters. His pursuit takes him through an Edinburgh beyond the tartan tearooms and cobbled streets of the tourist brochures, a modern city boasting a variety of criminals and their victims. As Rebus contemplates the lurking immortality of his own city, Rankin offers readers page-turning suspense and astonishing literary grace. <br></p><p>Inspector John Rebus of Edinburgh's finest has been knocking readers' socks off for years, in 10 full-length police procedurals by Ian Rankin that star the thoughtful, intelligent Scot. In this neat little novella, he does in 73 pages what many of his peers take three times as long to do--set an interesting scene, solve a crime, develop a character, and allow him to grow and change without sacrificing either pace or plot. Agreeing to track down the missing son of his high school sweetheart and her husband, a friend of his youth, Rebus takes the reader into the gritty back streets and criminal byways of Edinburgh, following Damon Mee from the nightclub where he was last seen through gambling casinos, football matches, and face-to-face encounters with the mobsters who may have been involved in his disappearance. Along the way Rebus confronts his own mortality, the choices he's made, and the obligations he owes his past. The theme of vanishing was spun off from <i>Dead Souls</i>, a full- length novel; according to Rankin, he wrote this brief but fully-realized piece first, then cannibalized part of it as a sub-plot for <i>Dead Souls</i>, "while altering the histories of the characters involved so that both can be read independently." Which is why American fans who haven't yet read <i>Dead Souls</i> will pick it up right after this one. <i>Death Is Not the End</i> is short enough to read on a shuttle flight and still have time for a nap. But like Rankin's other solid Rebus stories, it will stay with you even after you wake up. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Ian Rankin was nominated for an Edgar for <i>Black and Blue</i>, for which he won England's prestigious Gold Dagger Award.

The year is 1919, and Ian Rutledge is a fragile yet courageous former soldier searching for his place in a postwar world. Now a Scotland Yard investigator, Rutledge is called upon to probe a small-town murder &#x2014; and discovers that it may be connected to one of the greatest disasters of all time....<br><br><b>Watchers of Time<br></b><br>In Osterley, a marshy Norfolk backwater, a man lies dying on a rainy autumn night. While natural causes will surely claim Herbert Baker&#x2019;s life in a matter of hours, his last request baffles his family and friends. <br><br>Baker, a devout Anglican, inexplicably demands to see the town&#x2019;s Catholic priest for a last confession. The old man dies without knowing that the very priest who gave him comfort will follow him to the grave just a few weeks later &#x2014; the victim of an appalling murder.<br><br>The local police are convinced the evidence points to an interrupted robbery, and have named a suspect, Matthew Walsh. But the dead priest&#x2019;s bishop insists that Scotland Yard oversee the investigation. A simple task for Rutledge, a man not yet well enough to return to full duty. <br><br>The Inspector draws on years of experience and a war-honed intuition as he finds himself uncovering secrets that the local authorities would prefer not to see explored. Surely, they reason, it is better to charge an outsider &#x2014; Matthew Walsh &#x2014; with murder than to learn that someone in this tightly knit community would commit such a horrendous crime. And yet there are those, Rutledge soon discovers, who held grudges against the priest that had little to do with God or the Church. <br><br>No one in Osterley is aware that Rutledge hears voices &#x2014; or, rather, one haunting voice: that of a soldier he was forced to execute during the War. It is with the voice of Hamish MacLeod, by turns second-guessing and taunting him, that Rutledge begins a journey toward the devastating truth that will unlock the secrets of Osterley and pare away its layers of deception. <br><br>And in piecing together a different story, Rutledge encounters a chain of events that stretches from these brooding marshes to one of the greatest sea disasters in history &#x2014; the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>. Who is the mysterious woman who may have boarded that ship ... and who is the secretive woman who survived it? Rutledge comes to believe that he alone can stop a killer from striking again. <br><br>Deftly capturing the anguish of a man haunted by his tragic past, <b>Watchers of Time</b> delves beneath a cast of unforgettable characters to examine a mystery even greater than murder: the mystery of what is right and what is wrong after the world has committed the sin of war.</p><p>Praise for the novels of Charles Todd:<br><br><b>Legacy of the Dead<br></b>A New York Times Notable Book of the Year<br><br>&#x201c;Eloquent ... rich.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; The New York Times Book Review<br><br>&#x201c;Readers will continue to be captivated by Todd&#x2019;s portrait of the dangerously unraveling detective, and his equally incisive evocation of the grieving post-war world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; Publishers Weekly<br><br><b>Search the Dark<br></b><br>&#x201c;Todd works ... volatile elements into a remarkable village mystery ... driven by characters of great psychological complexity.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; The New York Times Book Review<br><br>&#x201c;Todd&#x2019;s Ian Rutledge mysteries are among the most intelligent and affecting being written these days.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; The Washington Post Book World<br><br><b>Wings of Fire<br></b>A New York Times Notable Book of the Year<br><br>&#x201c;[Todd wraps] his challenging plot, complex characters, and subtle psychological insights in thick layers of atmosphere.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; The New York Times Book Review<br><br>&#x201c;A strong mystery, filled with fine characterizations [and] a superb eye for Cornwall ...

It provides&nbsp;an easy, step-by-step program that utilizes the fat-melting power of tea to jumpstart readers' metabolisms and heal at the same time. Readers can expect to lose up to 10 pounds of stubborn fat, sleep more soundly, feel more energized, and dramatically reduce their risk of chronic diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly Choi is a food journalist, broadcaster, chef, and cooking contest judge based in New York City.Before you begin the The 7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse, take a moment to think about your past drinking habits. No, not that time in college when you got arrested for streaking through the quad at 1 am. I mean the stuff you drink every day: sodas, sweet teas, energy drinks, lattes, juices and the like.<br> &nbsp;<br> The average American now drinks about a gallon of soda a week. Add to that our odd new habits of swapping tap water for bottled &#x201c;vitamin&#x201d; water (+120 calories) and giving up plain iced coffee for Mocha Frappucinos (+520 calories) and you can see how quickly the calories add up&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s before chugging an &#x201c;energy drink&#x201d; that tastes exactly like what would happen if a crazed pastry chef hijacked a truckload of Smarties and drove it into a battery acid factory (another 280 calories). Those three drinks alone give you 920 additional calories&#x2014;almost half a day&#x2019;s worth!<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, liquid calories now make up a whopping 21 percent of our daily calorie intake&#x2014;more than 400 calories every single day, more than twice as much as we drank 30 years ago. To give you a perspective on those numbers, imagine taking two slices of Pizza Hut Thin &#x2018;N Crispy Pepperoni Pizza, tossing them in a blender and hitting &#x201c;puree,&#x201d; then drinking the whole thing down. That&#x2019;s 420 calories. Now imagine that the typical American has been doing this every single day for years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wow. Disgusting, right?<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, but behind those slightly sickening statistics comes some great news. Because if you want to strip away pounds, shrink your belly, and begin to sculpt a leaner, fitter body&#x2014;while also boosting your health, calming your mind and fighting back against some of the most significant diseases of our time&#x2014;just changing what you drink could be all you need.<br> &nbsp;<br> One study at Johns Hopkins University found that people who cut liquid calories from their diets lose more weight&#x2014;and keep it off longer&#x2014;than people who cut food calories. Simply cutting out liquid calories&#x2014;by switching your usual drink to tea&#x2014;could save you nearly 42 pounds this year alone! (Sorta makes that genie look real, doesn&#x2019;t it?)<br> &nbsp;<br> So to start using the Tea Cleanse, you first have to rid yourself of the liquid toxins your body has been piling up. Here&#x2019;s how to do it:<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 1: Swear Off the Soda and Bottled Teas<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 12 pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> According to the National Institutes of Health, the third largest source of food calories in the American diet isn&#x2019;t a food at all. It&#x2019;s soda. We get more calories from soda every day than we do meat, dairy or anything other than baked goods. How can that be possible? Because of all the sugar. Mountain Dew, for example, not only delivers 52 grams of sugar per 12-ounce can, but gives you a delicious side helping of bromated vegetable oil, a component of rocket fuel. And I don&#x2019;t mean metaphorical rocket fuel&#x2014;I mean the stuff they actually put in the engines to keep the gears from exploding.<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 2: Don&#x2019;t Drink Juice Drinks<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 19 pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> If the FDA ever forces drink manufacturers to start properly labeling their products, SunnyD would have to be called Obesi-D. (Some versions of the brand have up to 180 calories and 40 grams of sugar per serving.) Most of these &#x201c;juice&#x201d; drinks are really just water and high fructose corn syrup. If you drink just one of these a day, cut it out&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll lose 19 pounds this year!<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 3: Trade Coffee Drinks for Tea<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 25 pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> Researchers studied the coffee habits of New Yorkers and discovered that two-thirds of Starbucks customers opted for blended coffee drinks over regular brewed coffee or tea. The average caloric impact of the blended drinks was 239 calories. Switch to tea just once a day and you&#x2019;d lose 25 pounds this year! (Actually, you may lose more, as coffee has been linked to belly fat storage. A research team in Washington found that five or more cups of Joe a day doubled visceral fat.)<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 4: Use Tea to &#x201c;Flavor&#x201d; Your Water<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 13� pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> In one of the greatest feats of marketing ever, Vitaminwater produces products that sound a lot like health drinks but are nothing more than straight-up sugar. Its Power-C Dragonfruit flavored water has 120 calories and 31 grams of sugar&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the equivalent of drinking 13 Jolly Ranchers. You would lose more than a pound a month just by making this one swap each day.<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 5: Choose Tea Over Juice<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 14� pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> What could be healthier than this: Langers Pomegranate Blueberry Plus. It&#x2019;s 100 percent juice, says so right on the label. But the &#x201c;Plus&#x201d; is juice concentrate, which is so sweet that Langers packs 30 grams of sugar in each 8 ounce glass: that&#x2019;s the sugar equivalent of two&#x2014;two!&#x2014;Snicker&#x2019;s Ice Cream Bars.<br> &nbsp;<br> STEP 6: Make Your Own Iced Tea<br> ANNUAL WEIGHT LOSS: 13� pounds<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re a Snapple fan, you probably saw &#x201c;Tea Cleanse&#x201d; and thought, Great! But bottled teas aren&#x2019;t necessarily the answer. First, once a tea is made and sits on a supermarket shelf for, oh, an entire NFL season, the nutrients have spent enough time exposed to light and air that they begin to break down. Plus, who knows what else has worked its way into that bottle? Snapple&#x2019;s All Natural Green Tea packs 120 calories and 30 grams of sugar, while Ssips Green Tea with Honey &amp; Ginseng is sweetened not so much with honey but with high fructose corn syrup.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> DON&#x2019;T HIT THE BOTTLE<br> &nbsp;<br> A few years back, the authors of Eat This, Not That! commissioned ChromaDex laboratories to analyze 14 different bottled green teas for their levels of disease-fighting catechins. While Honest Tea Honey Green Tea topped the charts with an impressive 215 milligrams of total catechins, some products weren&#x2019;t even in the game. For instance, Republic of Tea Pomegranate Green Tea had only 8 milligrams, and Ito En Teas&#x2019; Tea Lemongrass Green had just 28 milligrams, despite implying on its label that the product is packed with antioxidants.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why the discrepancy? The fact is, store-bought teas typically lose 20 percent of EGCG/catechin content during the bottling process, which is why brewing your own is so critical. If you really want bottled tea then shoot for versions with an acid like lemon juice or citric acid, which help stabilize EGCG levels. Recent studies show that the more acidic the environment, the more stable the tea&#x2019;s nutrients. But even in a highly acidic drink, more than half of the nutrients are gone within 3 months.<br> &nbsp;<br> I believe in The 7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse because I&#x2019;ve seen the power of tea, and I&#x2019;ve experienced it for myself. Tea saved my mother&#x2019;s life, and has changed the lives of so many people I know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tea has not only given me control over my body, my health, and my weight, but it has also given me something far more valuable: control over my mind, my stress, and my time.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was during a short time in Seoul, South Korea, while I was pursuing a media career, that my love affair with tea truly began. In Korea, tea is as common as bottled water in America. Everywhere you look, vending machines are selling not cans of Coke but 60-cent cups of hot tea. And so, wanting to fit in, I too joined the tea culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that&#x2019;s when everything changed. Tea will literally squelch your appetite and make staying slim utterly effortless. When you drink tea, you do more than nourish yourself. You join an international community of people around the world who are engaging in the very same rituals as you. Throughout Asia, tea is practically a national drink. In places like Morocco, you&#x2019;ll never enter a home without being offered tea&#x2014;it&#x2019;s considered rude! From England to India, people plan their travel and work schedules around tea.<br> &nbsp;<br> And tea is both a private and a social event. Nobody thinks of getting together for a soda; drinking alone isn&#x2019;t a very good sign; and coffee is a great drink, but one that comes with its own jittery side effects. Tea stands alone as the ritual you can enjoy alone before bedtime, or with a close girlfriend catching up on the latest gossip.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that&#x2019;s why only tea makes sense as the basis of a cleanse that you can revisit over and over again. You don&#x2019;t have to order it from a fancy delivery service, spend oodles of your hard-earned dough on proprietary concoctions, or become a monk who can&#x2019;t join in social events because there&#x2019;s none of your magic elixir on hand. If you have a few dimes and access to hot water, you&#x2019;ve got it made.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve already shared with you the power of this amazing brew. Now I want to share with you the principles of the Tea Cleanse, so you can begin experiencing its magic immediately.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Mary, Did You Know?: The Story of God&#39;s Great Plan</h2><p>One of the most popular Christmas songs of our time, "Mary, Did You Know?" has dramatically impacted the lives of countless listeners.

Probably not--no one has the time.I came home thinking it wasn't fair. We who have to live gluten free are just as busy, and starting from scratch may often seem more trouble than a treat is worth. Some gluten-free mixes can be ordered or found in the health food stores, but they're expensive, and we have to take the trouble to order by phone or mail or look up that distant store. There's the additional problem that the mixes, while gluten free, can still contain some ingredient to which we may be allergic, such as lactose, soy, or corn.With this in mind, I started creating more mixes you can stir up in your own kitchen to pull out when time is short. I have discovered that, with alterations, I can make my Buttermilk Biscuit Mix (here into biscuits or muffins and even bases for quiches and meat pies. The Pancake and Waffle Mix turns out a great sponge cake.To save all that measuring and whisking and flour on the kitchen floor when I want a pie, I put together a whole bag of the Dream Pastry Mix so I can make several different types of crusts with almost no trouble. And as for pasta, all I do is measure some liquid egg substitute or crack an egg and add with 1 tablespoon of oil to a cup of the Pasta Base Mix, then roll it out for homemade noodles or lasagne. After a lot of trials (with the resultsending in the garbage disposal), I finally found the combination for a Basic Cake Mix that can be made with your choice of liquids, whether you desire a lactose-free cake, a soy-free one, or a cake that contains neither.And if you've hungered for that box of Rice-A-Roni to stir up a quick rice and pasta dish, I've discovered we can even make this at home.Because I use the Onion Soup Mix and the Powdered Soup Base from <i>More from the Gluten-free Gourmet</i> so much that they stand beside the salt and pepper by my kitchen stove, I have included them here. I've added two new flavors to the soup--cheese and shrimp. In this book you'll find a lot of recipes using these time-savers.Many of the mixes start with GF Flour Mix. You can order this from a supplier listed on here or make your own.

In this tenth anniversary edition of <i>The Nurture Assumption</i>, Judith Harris has updated material throughout and provided a fresh introduction.<br><br>Combining insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, primatology, and evolutionary biology, she explains how and why the tendency of children to take cues from their peers works to their evolutionary advantage. This electrifying book explodes many of our unquestioned beliefs about children and parents and gives us a radically new view of childhood.</p><p>Whether it's musical talent, criminal tendencies, or fashion sense, we humans want to know why we have it or why we don't. What makes us the way we are? Maybe it's in our genes, maybe it's how we were raised, maybe it's a little of both--in any case, Mom and Dad usually receive both the credit and the blame. But not so fast, says developmental psychology writer Judith Rich Harris. While it has been shown that genetics is only partly responsible for behavior, it is also true, Harris asserts, that parents play a very minor role in mental and emotional development. <i>The Nurture Assumption</i> explores the mountain of evidence pointing away from parents and toward peer groups as the strongest environmental influence on personality development. Rather than leaping into the nature vs. nurture fray, Harris instead posits nurture (parental) vs. nurture (peer group), and in her view your kid's friends win, hands down. This idea, difficult as it may be to accept, is supported by the countless studies Harris cites in her breezy, charming prose. She is upset about the blame laid on parents of troubled children and has much to say (mostly negative) about "professional parental advice-givers." Her own advice may be summarized as "guide your child's peer-group choices wisely," but the aim of the book is less to offer guidance than to tear off cultural blinders. Harris's ideas are so thought-provoking, challenging, and potentially controversial that anyone concerned with parenting issues will find <i>The Nurture Assumption</i> refreshing, important, and possibly life-changing. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Judith Rich Harris</b> is the author of <i>No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality </i>.

Worked to the same degree of accuracy as traditional botanical paintings, Billy&#39;s compositions are given a more contemporary twist, combining her unique eye for design with her love of flowers. In this book, 40 flower portraits are presented, arranged in alphabetical order, each one accompanied by small studies, details, step-by-step instructions and the colour mixes used to accomplish the finished work. At the start of the book there are useful sections on the materials and equipment needed and the main techniques used, including wet-into-wet, colour blending, lifting out, layering glazes, dry brushing and colour mixing, and at the end of the book Billy gives her own unique slant on composition and discusses the importance of creating a sketchbook. Whether you love to paint, or simply love flowers, this book will delight and inspire you.</p><p>Billy Showell graduated from St Martins School of Art with a B.A. in fashion design, but was irresistably drawn to painting and illustration. In 1993 she set course for a career as an artist and now paints, illustrates and teaches botanical painting at her studio and art clubs in the UK, USA and Australia. She lives in Tunbridge Wells, UK with her husband and two sons. Billy has been awarded five Certificates of Botanical Merit from the Society of Botanical Artists and her first book on watercolour flower portraits has been hugely successful in the UK and abroad. Billy&#39;s paintings are collected by her followers the world over and many are available as limited edition prints.Summer Catalogue 2014 This enchanting book and DVD set is bursting with top tips &amp; detailed demonstrations to help you paint 40 breathtaking blooms. * SAA * Dec 10 Following her first two books on painting flowers - Watercolour Flower Portraits and Watercolour Fruit &amp; Vegetable Portraits, Billy Showell brings us her A-Z of Flower Portraits. The book opens with a section on composition, followed by useful advice on keeping a sketchbook, placing the flowers on the paper, and the importance of lighting. A chapter on materials and equipment precedes several pages on techniques, including such subjects as colour blending, lifting out, negative veining (a way of creating pale veins by lifting out fine, bright lines), layering glazes, masking out and texture and pattern. Billy realises that most of us don't have endless time to experiment with colour mixes and helps us on our way by giving us details of her own mixes resulting from hours of trial and error. The colour mixes (which are beautifully reproduced by the publisher) start each section, describing the colours you need to combine to get the desired subtlety of colour for your subject. Less experienced artists can work through these preliminary sections, while more experienced artists may prefer to go straight to the projects. Forty painting projects are included, with subjects ranging from flower names of every letter of the alphabet, starting with anemones and aquilegia and ending with the zantedeschia (white arum lily to you and me). Billy is an inspirational flower painter, taking the best of the traditions of botanical painting yet imbuing her work with her own contemporary signature - a skill that has earned her five certificates of botanical merit from the Society of Botanical Artists. * Leisure Painter, The * Oct 10 Billy Showell is a fantastic watercolour artist. When I first saw her work I was amazed at how she takes the subject and renders is with an almost botanical attention to detail and yet has that magic touch that transforms work from what could be a somewhat stilted reproduction of flower, fruit or vegetable into a stunning and attractive work of art. Needless to say - I simply love her work and as very excited to read about her new book. In this book she takes 40 different flowers and shows us simple touches from simply observing closely tiny details specific to each flower, to the colour mixes she uses to create works, and different techniques such as wet in wet and lifting out. Its the clever extra touches such as the tulips on page 9 where she has used their natural tendency to curve and bend to form a heart shape from two stems that make her works so special. Of course its Billy's love for flowers and constant observation that allows her to know these differing characteristics to each plant. By observing plants around us and using a sketchbook as she advises we can learn this too. The paintings themselves are not quite the usual step by step paintings so common to art books but present a bit more of a challenge. I'm sure that will appeal to many artist who want to develop their own style rather than just follow other peoples instructions. Its certainly one of the things that make her books so exciting for me. Billy tells us the colour mixes needed for each flower and from observing the full page illustration we follow her instructions to complete that flower. With some of the more complex flowers she gives additional "mini demos" to show the best way to render the petals. The beauty of working this way is that it allows the artist to become a participant in the painting rather than simply a follower of instruction, and once confident that your rose or tulip you've painted following her advice is competent you will feel encouraged to do it again with one from the garden or supermarket with new colours and shapes. A superb book, full of exciting ideas for the artist who wants to do more than just follow instructions. * JeannieZelos.com * Oct 10 Following her successful volumes on flowers, fruit and veg, Billy Showell returns with a collection of step-by-step instructions for painting a variety of plant species, alongside information on specific techniques like masking out and glazing. Showell doesn't aim for strict botanical accuracy, instead opting for a fresher artistic flourish in her work. While the practical aspect of the book is undebiably useful, this is also a great chance to see the artist's intricate flower portraits reproduced across many of the spreads. From anemone seeds to spots on the petals of a Stargazer, the level of detail she has achieved is astonishing, particulary considering these are watercolours. It all confirms Showell not just as an impressive floral painter, but also as one of the UK's leading watercolour artists in any genre. * Artists &amp; Illustrators, The * Oct 10 Billy Showell approaches her subjects with the same level of accuracy as botanical artists. Her flowers are meticulous and realistic, but infused with her distinctive sense of design to give them a modern twist. This book gives information on materials and equipment needed, as well as clear instructions on the main techniques used, including wet-in-wet, laying glazes, dry brushing, lifting out, using body colour, masking and creating texture and pattern. There are details on colour mixing and on how to get the best out of brushes as well as insights into composition ideas and on keeping a sketchbook. There are also detailed step-by-step instructions showing how to paint 40 specific flower portraits, each accompanied by small studies, including a colour swatch illustrating the palette and paint mixes used for the work. Billy Showell's fans will need no further recommendation. If you are new to her work, you will be delighted at the clarity of instruction, the delicacy and vibrancy of the paintings, and the invaluable advice and inspiration this book offers. * Artist, The * Dec 10 If you want to paint professional and attractive botanical pictures of flowers, here is a good place to start. Ms Showell's earlier book on Watercolor Fruit and Vegetable Portraits (also reviewed on this site) showed how lovely even the humble spud could look when transformed into the sort of painting you could encounter in a priceless 18th century book. Now this talented artist turns her hand to flower painting, and it is time to get those watercolors out once again. Actually you can also find my review of Watercolour Flower Portraits in our archives as well, so prepare for more beautiful floral studies. Search Press is not known for their hardcover books but this is one, which will perhaps give you a clue that this is going to be something special. I love the way the flowers look so three-dimensional against the starkness of the white paper, and if your watercolors manage to look insipid then this is one lesson you can learn from this book to start with. There is good advice about composition, keeping a sketchbook and of course what to buy as well as mastering techniques such as wet-in-wet, color mixing, masking etc. Of course much of this is common to watercolor painting of any type, but I liked how it was all applied to florals with plenty of examples. Here too is advice on veining your leaves; painting fine hairs on stems, creating realistic water droplets and what colors you need to buy for flower painting. The flowers chosen are all garden favourites, ranging from traditional roses and lilies to daffodils and fritillaries, as well as yuccas, pitcher plants and quesnelia. Each project features a large, whole page study of the bloom along with a pencil sketch of part of it with some color added. There are instructions (not the type with staged photographs but just in writing) as well as a color swatch of all the paints you need to buy and what they look like mixed into the relevant shades. A short piece about the flowers together with the artist's own reason for choosing them completes the entry, making it eminently suitable for all those watercolorists who have progressed beyond beginner primers and are wanting something more intermediate and relevant to their chosen subject. This is also just a lovely book to gaze at, a celebration of flowers and a handsome addition to bookshelves (and coffee tables) everywhere. Highly recommended. * Myshelf.com *</p><h2>A Fool&#39;s Errand: Creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture in the Age of Bush, Obama, and Trump</h2><p><b>Founding Director Lonnie Bunch's deeply personal tale of the triumphs and challenges of bringing the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to life.

As the key attorney assisting Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, she argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court (winning all but one), and her representation of James Meredith in his bid to enroll in the University of Mississippi made her famous. Subsequently, as Manhattan borough president and a U.S. district court judge, she has fulfilled the highest aspirations of our legal and political system.</p><p>This book, the most detailed account to date of the legal conflicts of the civil rights movement, is also an account of Motley's struggle, as a black woman, to succeed, a record of a life lived with great courage and responsibility.</p></p><p>Much like the Delany sisters of Brooklyn, Constance Baker Motley was one of the first black women to overcome the barriers of race and sex to become a leading figure in her field of expertise. In the mid '60s, Motley became the first black female senator, the first black woman elected to the office of Manhattan borough president, and the first woman appointed to the federal bench. Now a senior judge in a U.S. District Court of New York, Motley looks back on a lifetime of unprecedented achievements and gives personal testimony to some of the greatest moments in the civil rights movement in her autobiography, <i>Equal Justice Under Law</i>. Her story is an impressive one: she dramatically recounts sitting on-stage with her son as Martin Luther King Jr. gave his "I Have a Dream" speech and recalls the traumatic times in Mississippi that led to the murder of her colleague and friend, Medgar Evers. She served on the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund, fought alongside Thurgood Marshall in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i>, and made 10 other appearances before the Supreme Court. Fascinating as Motley's life has been, those with some prior knowledge of civil rights may fare best with this book, considering its weighted language and complex prose--an expected caveat, considering the author has spent her life steeped in the language of law.<p><b>Constance Baker Motley</b> is a senior judge and a former chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

This Fiftieth Anniversary edition of Harry Edwards's classic of activist scholarship arrives even as a new generation engages with the issues he explored. Edwards's new introduction and afterword revisit the revolts by athletes like Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tommie Smith, and John Carlos. At the same time, he engages with the struggles of a present still rife with racism, double-standards, and economic injustice. Again relating the rebellion of black athletes to a larger spirit of revolt among black citizens, Edwards moves his story forward to our era of protests, boycotts, and the dramatic politicization of athletes by Black Lives Matter. Incisive yet ultimately hopeful, <i>The Revolt of the Black Athlete</i> is the still-essential study of the conflicts at the interface of sport, race, and society.</p></p><p><b>Harry Edwards</b> is professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the architect of the Olympic Project for Human Rights and his work has focused on the experiences of African-American athletes. His other books include <i>The Struggle that Must Be: An Autobiography</i>."The legendary Harry Edwards illuminates this edition with a deeply probing and personal half-century of perspectives, reflections, and wisdom. Edwards must have written this masterpiece with the assistance of a crystal ball. A generation later, it remains relevant to the current climate of athletic activism, and cannot be read without profit."--Al-Tony Gilmore, Historian and Archivist Emeritus, National Education Association<br><br> "A useful addition to any syllabus for students of American politics or of journalism and in particular sports journalism."--<i>Irish Independent</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"A must read for all scholars, activists, athletes, and sport enthusiasts. . . . Edwards commandingly expresses how the collective voices and unified actions of Black athletes can evoke institutional change. The Revolt of the Black Athlete uncovers the axiom by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, 'a threat to justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,' even at institutions of higher education."--Billy D. Hawkins, author of<i> The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions</i><br><br> "Edward's essential position in the movement, his memory of the events, and his ability to connect them to present-day activism make this book a must-read."--<i>Journal&nbsp;of Sport History</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"When whites respond to black protests with anger and resentment, unable to see the experiences of those who don't enjoy white privilege, that indicates that we have a lot of work yet to do. The re-printing of <i>The Revolt of the Black Athlete</i> comes at a perfect time to help us do that work and Dr. Edwards gives us an amazing example of someone who has spent his life not just talking the talk, but walking the walk."--Theresa Walton-Fisette, President of the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport<br><br> "The book remains highly relevant to the current climate of athletic activism and stands out as an important piece of sport history as well as a road map for critical discussions of sport." --idrottsforum.org<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Strange Trees: And the Stories Behind Them</h2><p>Have you ever heard of the Strangler Tree?

We enjoy going to museums and art shows together and whenever I need advice about one of my illustrations I can ask for their help. My life is full of art, music, theater, and friends.

She had a very creative father who told her stories and encouraged her to draw and inspired tales of trolls and other folklore. In fourth grade she wrote an essay called "Why I Want to Be an Illustrator When I Grow Up." An eye for detail comes from her love of science (she has a degree in Biology and a minor in Art) and her imaginative animals come from her father's fables. She lives in a remote area in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she is surrounded by wildlife that is a constant inspiration for her work.

She has a redheaded husband, a daughter named Clara who is 12 years old and writes poetry, and a son, Nathan, age 9, who is a Jedi-wannabe and knows more about dinosaurs than anyone else Paula knows.

The titular &#x201c;Hot Comb&#x201d; is about a young girl&#x2019;s first perm&#x2015;a doomed ploy to look cool and stop seeming &#x201c;too white&#x201d; in the all-black neighborhood her family has just moved into. In &#x201c;Virgin Hair,&#x201d; taunts of &#x201c;tender-headed&#x201d; sting as much as the perm itself. &#x201c;My Lil Sister Lena&#x201d; shows the stress of being the only black player on a white softball team. Lena&#x2019;s hair is the team curio, an object to be touched, a subject to be discussed and debated at the will of her teammates, leading Lena to develop an anxiety disorder of pulling her own hair out.

One of the finest writers of her age, Adams passionately campaigned for women&#x2019;s education, denounced sex discrimination, and matched wits not only with her brilliant husband, John, but with Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. When male Patriots ignored her famous appeal to &#x201c;Remember the Ladies,&#x201d; she accomplished her own personal declaration of independence: Defying centuries of legislation that assigned married women&#x2019;s property to their husbands, she amassed a fortune in her own name.<br> <br>Adams&#x2019;s life story encapsulates the history of the founding era, for she defined herself in relation to the people she loved or hated (she was never neutral), a cast of characters that included her mother and sisters; Benjamin Franklin and James Lovell, her husband&#x2019;s bawdy congressional colleagues; Phoebe Abdee, her father&#x2019;s former slave; her financially na�ve husband; and her son John Quincy.<br> <br>At once epic and intimate, Abigail Adams, sheds light on a complicated, fascinating woman, one of the most beloved figures of American history.</p><p><b>Abner Linwood "Woody" Holton, III, Ph.D.</b>&nbsp;is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Richmond in Virginia and is a member of the Richmond Research Institute.&nbsp; He has published two award-winning books: <i>Unruly Americans and the Origins of the Constitution</i> (2007), a finalist for the National Book Award; and <i>Forced Founders: Indians, Debtors, Slaves and the Making of the American Revolution in Virginia</i> (1999).&nbsp; Holton received his B.A. in English from the University of Virginia and his&nbsp;Ph.D. in History from Duke, and&nbsp;is currently an associate professor at the University of Richmond. Holton has received numerous awards, including three from the Organization of American Historians (OAH). His first book, <i>Forced Founders </i>(in which he argued that Jefferson, Washington, and other Virginia gentlemen rebelled against Britain partly in order to regain control of Native Americans, slaves, and small farmers), received the OAH&#x2019;s prestigious Merle Curti award for social history. In 2006, the OAH named Holton one of its Distinguished Lecturers. Holton&#x2019;s article, &#x201c;&#x2018;Divide et Impera&#x2019;: The Tenth Federalist in a Wider Sphere,&#x201d; was selected by a panel of distinguished scholars for publication in the OAH&#x2019;s <i>Best American History Essays 2006</i>.&nbsp; Holton received a Guggenheim Fellowship for the 2008-09 academic year to write&nbsp;ABIGAIL ADAMS and today lives in Richmond with his wife Gretchen Schoel (the director of an organization combating prejudice against Arabs and Muslims) and their daughter Beverly.Holton seamlessly blends Abigail Adams&#39;s copious letters and journals with explanatory text. Narrator Cassandra Campbell&#39;s delivery of this well-researched biography is equally smooth. Employing only subtle changes in pitch and pace as events and emotions demand, Campbell gives Adams voice and differentiates a wide-ranging cast of additional correspondents. Holton uses Adams&#39;s writings, and those of her contemporaries, to create a portrait of her as a significant public figure and a devoted wife and mother. But he also depicts her as an independent, intelligent, resourceful woman whose attitudes and actions frequently placed her ahead of her time. Campbell&#39;s narration especially shines in her portrayal of those attributes.

Maybe we don't want to ask it. But viral videos, digital images, and other spectacles surround us in every direction--competing for our time, our attention, our lust, and our money. So we let our lazy eyes feed on whatever comes our way. As a result, we never stop to consider the consequences of our visual diet on our habits, desires, and longings.</p> <p>Journalist Tony Reinke asked these hard questions himself--critiquing his own habits--and now invites us along to see what he discovered as he investigated the possibilities and the pitfalls of our image-centered world. In the end, he shares the beauty of a Greater Spectacle--capable of centering our souls, filling our hearts, and stabilizing our gaze in this age of the digital spectacle.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tony Reinke</strong> is the communications director for desiringGod.org. He is the author of <em>Lit!: A Christian Guide to Reading</em> Books; <em>Newton on the Christian Life</em>; and <em>12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty years after Neil Postman&#x2019;s <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i>, Tony Reinke&#x2019;s <i>Competing Spectacles</i> takes the impact-analysis of modern media to new levels: a new height and new depth. New height, because Christ crucified, risen, and reigning is brought into the discussion as the Spectacle above all spectacles. New depth, because the focus is not on what is happening to politics, but what is happening to the human soul. The conception of this book is not cavalier; it is rooted in the profound biblical strategy of sanctification by seeing (2 Cor. 3:18). The spectacle of Christ&#x2019;s glory is &#x2018;the central power plant of Christian sanctification.&#x2019; Ugly spectacles make us ugly. Beautiful spectacles make us beautiful.

Now with this accessible, sagacious book, he has done so again. This book shows us how to pull our eyes away from the latest viral video or our digital avatars of self and toward the &#x2018;spectacle&#x2019; before which we often cringe and wince: the crucifixion of our Lord.

In these pages&#x2015;as illuminating as they are disturbing and challenging&#x2015;he stands in the tradition of the spiritual masters who have understood that the city of man&#x2019;s&#x2015;and woman&#x2019;s&#x2015;soul is often attacked and destroyed through eye-gate. But <i>Competing Spectacles</i> not only diagnoses our distorted vision; it prescribes spectacles that give us twenty-twenty spiritual vision.

The world seeks to captivate our attention through an endless stream of distractions, but Reinke encourages us to revive our hearts to the spectacle of Christ.

Every generation of Christians has faced this struggle, but never in a media-dominated culture like ours. So how can we meet the challenges and avoid the pitfalls of our day?

Pick up and read&#x2015;at your own peril, and for your soul&#x2019;s delight.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Trevin Wax</strong><strong>,</strong> Director for Bibles and Reference, LifeWay Christian Resources; author, <em>This Is Our Time</em>; <em>Eschatological Discipleship</em>; and <em>Gospel-Centered Teaching</em></p><p>&#x201c;Decades ago, Malcolm Muggeridge helped us notice something: the Bible came down to us not through Dead Sea Videotapes but through Dead Sea Scrolls. Nor <i>could</i> videotapes have brought us the Word. Now today, with similar insight, Tony Reinke helps us notice something: beyond the media images daily surrounding us, tempting us, intimidating us, and defrauding us, Christ the Word welcomes us. <i>Competing Spectacles</i> can guide us back to reality, honesty, and calm, as we lift our eyes humbly to the Crucified One and pray, &#x2018;Please show me <i>your</i> glory.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ray Ortlund</strong><strong>,</strong> Lead Pastor, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;Tony Reinke offers a succinct expos� of the threat that our image-saturated society poses to faith and to wisdom. Just as the noisiness of modern life so often prevents us from hearing God&#x2019;s voice, so mass-mediated images blind us from seeing Christ in the church, in the world, and in the face of our neighbor. Reinke&#x2019;s warning is that of the watchman who sees &#x2018;the sword coming against the land.&#x2019; We&#x2019;ll do well to heed his message.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Craig M.

Some have even gone so far as to suggest euthanasia as a solution to the perceived indignity of memory loss and the disorientation that accompanies it.<br><br> In this book John Swinton develops a practical theology of dementia for caregivers, people with dementia, ministers, hospital chaplains, and medical practitioners as he explores two primary questions: <ul><li>Who am I when I've forgotten who I am?</li><li>What does it mean to love God and be loved by God when I have forgotten who God is?</li></ul> Offering compassionate and carefully considered theological and pastoral responses to dementia and forgetfulness, Swinton's <i>Dementia: Living in the Memories of God</i> redefines dementia in light of the transformative counter story that is the gospel.</p><p>John Swinton is professor of practical theology andpastoral care at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, andfounding director of the Centre for Spirituality, Health,and Disability at Aberdeen.

Post</b><br> -- Stony Brook University; author of <i>The Hidden Gifts of Helping</i><br> "Swinton offers us the best constructive theology yet written on the important place for the deeply forgetful in our communities and our lives. His ability to elevate the most significant Christian scholarship on this topic to the level of a compelling new synthesis is clear on each thoughtful page. Those who want to reflect deeply on where individuals with dementia fit into our world will benefit from this breath of fresh air. It is a brilliant book that stays true to everything meaningful in Christian ethics, theology, and care."<br><br><b>Stephen Sapp</b><br> -- University of Miami; author of <i>When Alzheimer's Disease Strikes!</i><br> "Engagingly written and thoroughly researched, Swinton's Dementia is a ringing challenge to current thinking (and speaking and acting) about dementia.

It deserves a broad audience of both theologians and pastors since it challenges fundamental habits of thought, prayer, and service. Indeed, this book -- this offering -- provides hope. It demonstrates the power of faithful theology to engage very difficult, even frightening topics."<br><br><b>John Goldingay</b><br> -- Fuller Theological Seminary; author of <i>Remembering Ann</i><br> "For the last decade of her life my first wife, Ann, couldn't speak, not because she couldn't move her lips but because she could no longer work out what to say. She had dementia. . . . I would worry over how she and God could relate if she couldn't think straight, so I love Swinton's statement that people such as Ann 'remain tightly held within the memories of God' and I resonate with this description of the church as 'a living body of remembering friends.' Indeed, as I read this book, I kept saying, 'Yes, Yes, Yes!'

In Praying in the Spirit Bunyan defines what it means to pray with the spirit and with the understanding, and deals with difficulties in prayer. In The Throne of Grace, he explains how to approach God s throne in prayer and opens up the blessings God s people receive from the high priestly ministry of Jesus Christ.</p><p>John Bunyan was born in Elstow, near Bedford, in 1628, the son of Thomas Bunyan and Margaret Bentley. He followed his father into the tinker's trade but rebelled against God and 'had but few equals, both for cursing, swearing, lying, and blaspheming the holy name of God'. As a teenager, he joined Cromwell's New Model Army, but continued his rebellious ways. His life was saved on one occasion when a fellow-soldier took his place at the siege of Leicester, and 'as he stood sentinel he was shot in the head with a musket bullet and died'.<br><br>Discharged from the army after three years, Bunyan married a God-fearing woman (whose name is unknown) in 1648, who brought two books to the marriage: The Plain Man s Pathway to Heaven (Arthur Dent) and The Practice of Piety (Lewis Bayly). These convicted Bunyan of his sin and he made attempts to reform his life. But he realised that he was lost and without Christ when he came into contact with a group of women whose 'joyous conversation about the new birth and Christ deeply impressed him'. In 1651 the women introduced him to their pastor in Bedford, John Gifford, who was instrumental in leading Bunyan to repentance and faith.<br><br>In the following years, Bunyan began publishing books and became established as a reputable Puritan writer, but around this time, his first wife died. He remarried in 1659, a godly young woman named Elizabeth, who was to be a staunch advocate for her husband during his imprisonments for in 1660 Bunyan was arrested for preaching without official permission from King Charles II; he was to spend the next 12� years in Bedford County Gaol.<br><br>Although a time of much suffering, Bunyan's years in prison were productive, for he wrote extensively, with only the Bible and Foxe's Book of Martyrs beside him, publishing such titles as Christian Behaviour, The Holy City and A Defence of the Doctrine of Justification. Of particular significance for his life-story was Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, which chronicled his life up to the time of his imprisonment.<br><br>He was eventually released in 1672, and took up his pastorate in Bedford, having been appointed by the congregation the preceding January. After some fruitful years of ministry, in March of 1675 Bunyan was again imprisoned for preaching publicly without a license. It was during this imprisonment that he began the first part of his most famous book, The Pilgrim's Progress, which was to sell more than 100,000 copies in its first ten years in print.</p><h2>Ethics for Christian Ministry: Moral Formation for Twenty-First-Century Leaders</h2><p>This one-of-a-kind resource in professional ethics helps today&#39;s Christian leaders maintain a high moral character and lifestyle and sharpen their personal and professional decision-making skills. Two experienced teachers and pastors address both current and perennial ethical issues and offer guidance for developing a personal code of ethics to maintain integrity in the work of ministry. The authors address the nature of ethical decision making as well as practical areas where integrity can be compromised, including issues raised by the use of smartphones and social media. Appendixes include codes of ethics from various denominations.</p><p>"Two experienced, inspired pastoral theologians have given us a thorough, judicious book that is sure to become the standard text on pastoral ethics. Trull and Creech not only show a deep understanding of the particular challenges faced by those called to be clergy but also offer sound, practical guidance that helps pastors make better decisions as we engage in ministry. Here's a book that enables contemporary clergy to hold to the highest standards of our high and noble calling. What a wonderful contribution to the field of pastoral theology and ethics."<br>--<b>Will Willimon</b>, Duke Divinity School; United Methodist bishop, retired; author of <i>Calling and Character: Virtues of the Ordained Life</i><br><br>"Few things harm a congregation or ministry more than the profound moral failure of a trusted leader. Trull and Creech understand this reality, and they have created a comprehensive resource for pastors and congregations that addresses the importance of ethics in ministry. This book is both theological and practical, exploring essential codes of professional conduct for pastoral work. From ministers in training to seasoned pastors, all who read this book will benefit from the opportunity to think through the real temptations ministers face, the meaning of leading with integrity, and the absolute necessity of peer support and accountability. It is possible to create healthful boundaries for long-term ministry, and this book is an excellent guide for getting started."<br>--<b>Angela Reed</b>, Truett Seminary, Baylor University<br><br>"Trull and Creech offer an excellent work in ministerial ethics. They give the reader a historical and theological foundation for the ministerial calling and profession that serves as the springboard into ministerial ethics. The reader is given a reason for ministerial ethics, a route to accomplish professional ethics, and a challenge to create a professional code of ethics with colleagues. <i>Ethics for Christian Ministry</i> should be read by anyone called to vocational ministry, and it should be required reading by seminary students at the onset of their training.

There were storm clouds over Paradise as Jesse Stone looked out at the Atlantic and remembered his last night in L.A., staring out into that other ocean. What Jesse thought was that water color in sunlight was beside the point. At night, all oceans were black. He understood that a lot of people, maybe most, believed the ocean symbolized endless possibility, better days, bright futures. Jesse knew better. He took a sip of his Black Label and soda. He was alone, with only the ocean and his regrets for company. You can gaze at the road ahead of you all you want, but your future is in your rearview mirror.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Chief Stone,&#x201d; a busboy called to him.</p><p>Jesse was too busy time-traveling there on the dock behind the restaurant to hear.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me, Chief Stone,&#x201d; the kid tried again.</p><p>This time Jesse heard him and turned. He nodded at the kid.</p><p>&#x201c;The boss, he wants you to stop by the office before you leave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right in.&#x201d;</p><p>It was the usual kind of thing in a small town. Dan Castro, chef and owner of the Lobster Claw, was a squat man with sad brown eyes and the weight of the world pressing down on him. The place had been up and running for only two months and Dan had discovered why it was easier to want to own a restaurant than to actually own one. He wanted to know if Jesse could talk to the health inspector. Jesse was the police chief, so he must have a lot of pull with the selectmen, the Health Department, the dogcatcher. Jesse tried listening, without much success. Stared at Dan&#x2019;s moving lips, watched his gestures, but Jesse wasn&#x2019;t exactly in the moment. He was thinking about tomorrow&#x2019;s drive down to New York City, about the reunion. He had been thinking about it on and off for the last six weeks, ever since he&#x2019;d gotten the invitation from Vic Prado and sent back the little RSVP card with a check in the yes box. As the date got closer, it was all he could think about. He said something reassuring to Dan and left. It must have been good, because Castro&#x2019;s eyes weren&#x2019;t quite so sad, nor did he seem as much a victim of gravity.</p><p>As Jesse drove back home through the streets of Paradise, he tried to recall exactly what he had said to the restaurant owner. For the life of him, he couldn&#x2019;t remember. That&#x2019;s how distracted he was by what lay ahead of him over the next few days. The scotch hadn&#x2019;t helped with his memory and this reunion hadn&#x2019;t helped with the scotch. Jesse&#x2019;s tug-of-war with booze no longer held any romance for him, nor anyone else. He had a problem with drinking. It was like a given in a geometry equation. When he realized his words to Dan Castro were lost to him, Jesse shrugged and moved on. He remembered he was a cop, the top cop in a town fifteen miles outside of Boston. A million miles from L.A.</p><p>The rain came in a light spray not even heavy enough for Jesse to use the wipers. He studied the streets. He had settled into the rhythms of town life, but thought that only someone who didn&#x2019;t know him would describe Paradise as his adopted hometown. He&#x2019;d grown up in Tucson, lived in L.A., and now Paradise. Were any of them really home? That was for someone else to ponder. For the moment Jesse Stone was running through his checklist for tomorrow, making sure everything was set before he went down to New York. As he turned for home, the skies opened up, the rain falling in sheets so thick that he could no longer make out the streets of Paradise. He was no longer paying much mind to the rain or the streets. Distracted again, Jesse Stone was caught in a rundown between his past and New York City.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>The Salters&#x2019; place was a red brick Victorian nestled on an ocean bluff just north of the yacht club. As Victorian houses went, it was more reserved than most, smaller than the sprawling manses that dotted cities and towns throughout New England and points south. There was one spire, two chimneys, a widow&#x2019;s walk. No gazebo, no wraparound porch, no whimsical paint job, no whimsy at all. It stood solid and restrained as Harlan Salter, the dry-goods magnate who had commissioned it in 1888. The Salters still owned the place, but these days most of them split their time between Boston and the Vineyard.</p><p>Mostly it just sat up there on the bluff and reminded Paradise of a faded past.</p><p>There was one light on in a small bedroom on the second floor.</p><p>&#x201c;This place is so freakin&#x2019; creepy and so cool, Ben,&#x201d; said Martina Penworth.</p><p>Benjamin Salter made a face. &#x201c;We only use this place in the summer, and then not always.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any ghosts?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Plenty of spiders, though.&#x201d;</p><p>She slapped his biceps. &#x201c;I hate spiders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll protect you.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d;</i> she said and stepped closer to him. &#x201c;I just bet you will.&#x201d;</p><p>She angled her head up to his and planted her lips on Ben&#x2019;s. He returned the favor and it didn&#x2019;t take long for them to advance beyond kissing. When they came up for air, Ben grabbed the bottle of Pappy Van Winkle and took a swallow.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said, grabbing at the bottle, &#x201c;what about me?&#x201d;</p><p>Ben smiled, yanking the bottle out of her reach. &#x201c;Patience, baby, patience.&#x201d;</p><p>He took another swig but was careful not to swallow. He winked at Martina, pressed his mouth hard against hers. She parted her lips just enough so that the warm amber fluid drained slowly into her mouth from his. When she&#x2019;d taken it all in and swallowed, she sighed, and her body shuddered involuntarily. Ben reached for the hem of her T-shirt and lifted it over her head. She did the same for him and she kissed his chest, brushing her hand across his nipples. As Ben fingered the clasp of her bra, Martina pushed him away. She strolled around to the opposite side of the big cherrywood bed and swayed while she unhinged the silvery silken bra. She swung it over her head and threw it at him.</p><p>He snatched it out of the air, took in her scent, and stared at her pert breasts. Her nipples were red, erect, perfect, and he said so. There wasn&#x2019;t much about Martina Penworth that wasn&#x2019;t perfect. She had that sun-streaked blond hair other girls spent hundreds to imitate but could never quite pull off. Her eyes were a shade of deep blue that he hadn&#x2019;t seen before. Her lips, her nose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were all amazing. Nor did it hurt that Martina had the body of a cheerleader and the brain of a professor. He didn&#x2019;t much care about the latter at the moment. He knew he was lucky to have her. He wasn&#x2019;t bad-looking. He had been with plenty of girls before, but not girls like Martina. That was why he had brought her here. No dorm room beds or cheap Boston motels for her.</p><p>Just as Martina unbuttoned her jeans and began wriggling out of them, she thought she heard something coming from downstairs. Ben saw the look on her face.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an old house and it&#x2019;s storming like crazy. Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d; He half smiled. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s a ghost. Like I said, I&#x2019;ll protect you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was from spiders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Spiders and ghosts.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked around to her. He had waited long enough. They fell into bed together.</p><p>When they were done, she lay with her head on his hairless chest. They were silent. First times, even at their best, come with a certain amount of awkwardness. Besides, wanting and having are two very different things. Then the silence was broken, but not by either Ben or Martina.</p><p>The bedroom door flew back so hard that the old hinges nearly pulled away from the oak frame. As it was, the brass doorknob had made an oval dent in the plaster and lath. A tall man dressed in matte black military-style garb strode into the room. He wore a black balaclava over his head and face. Only his shark eyes and crooked mouth were visible. In his right hand he held a black sidearm with a sound suppressor extending from the barrel. He turned to face the two nude college freshmen, pointing the tip of the suppressor at them. Martina wanted to scream, but her fear swallowed it up. Instead, she dug her nails into Ben&#x2019;s biceps. He didn&#x2019;t feel it, not even when he bled.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, mister, my parents have a lot of money,&#x201d; Ben said, his voice cracking. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll pay you anything you want.&#x201d;</p><p>The gunman shook his head.</p><p>Ben realized this guy might be here for Martina. She was so hot, so perfect. Here she was for him, undressed and vulnerable.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about touching her,&#x201d; Ben warned. This time his voice was strong and steady.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not as good as you&#x2019;d think,&#x201d; he said, because he couldn&#x2019;t think of what else to say. &#x201c;She&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The gunman stifled a little laugh and put his left index finger across his lips to shush the boy. The boy shushed. The gunman waved the tip of the suppressor at Ben, gesturing him away from Martina. When the kid hesitated, the gunman put a round in the wall above the headboard. Ben got out of the bed, shaking. The gunman motioned for Ben to get on his knees at the side of the bed. Ben got on his knees.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, baby,&#x201d; Ben reassured Martina. &#x201c;He wants me, not you. Isn&#x2019;t that right, mister? You want me.&#x201d;</p><p>The gunman nodded, stepped close to Ben. Now there was something in the gunman&#x2019;s left hand. Before Ben could figure out what it was, he pressed it to Ben&#x2019;s neck and stunned the kid. Ben Salter collapsed to the floor, his convulsing body thumping against the bare wood. Tears streamed down Martina&#x2019;s face as the gunman turned the tip of the suppressor in her direction. The gun barked twice and Martina Penworth stopped crying forever.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>Jesse Stone stared at himself in the full-length mirror as he adjusted his bow tie. He had always looked good in uniform&#x2014;Albuquerque Dukes, USMC, L.A.P.D., or Paradise PD dress blues, it didn&#x2019;t matter. A tuxedo, he thought, was just another kind of uniform. He had been away from baseball for many years now, but he kept in good shape. He was no more than five pounds heavier than when he was a soft-handed shortstop prospect in the Dodgers&#x2019; organization. While he hadn&#x2019;t been a five-tool phenom, he had the requisite skills to make it to the bigs: great glove, cannon arm, quick pivot, adequate speed, average bat, less-than-average power. What he lacked in natural physical skills he compensated for with what sports types called intangibles. He rarely made mental errors. Bonehead plays were what other guys made. He was like a manager on the field, mentally tough. That much hadn&#x2019;t changed. When some wiseass pitcher tried backing him away from the plate with a little chin music, Jesse dusted himself off, and stood a few inches closer to the plate for the next pitch. As one scout wrote, &#x201c;Stone always seems to be in the right place at the right time.&#x201d; Not always.</p><p>It was precisely because he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time that he was forced to trade in his baseball uniform for all the others. Now the closest he was ever going to get to the infield dirt at Dodger Stadium was the softball fields of Paradise, Mass. He was the terror of the team, playing for the police department slo-pitch squad. His less-than-average power in pro baseball made him the Hank Aaron of the softball diamond, but that wasn&#x2019;t much compensation for a man who was once a phone call away from the Dodgers. He made one last adjustment to his tie before heading downstairs. Time to face the music.</p><p>Jesse Stone wasn&#x2019;t big on irony, but even he couldn&#x2019;t ignore the fact that there was almost nothing standard about The Standard, High Line. The angular glass, steel, and concrete beast straddled the elevated High Line park that ran along the west side of Manhattan from the Meatpacking District to West 30th Street. He couldn&#x2019;t decide whether he liked the exterior of the building or not. It was like both something out of the 1960s and a sci-fi movie. Not that he had seen many sci-fi movies. He didn&#x2019;t much care for movies, except Westerns and they didn&#x2019;t make many Westerns anymore. The interior was just weird, provocative for provocative&#x2019;s sake. Until he arrived and read up on the place, Jesse hadn&#x2019;t been aware of the least standard thing about The Standard: its reputation. The Standard was infamous for couples renting rooms, pulling back their curtains, and having sex in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows for people strolling the High Line to see. The Standard had always seemed like an odd choice for a reunion of a minor-league baseball team from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Now that Jesse had seen it, knew its rep, the place seemed an even less likely choice. He shook his head.</p><p>At the elevator, he fidgeted with his tie some more. When the elevator door opened, Jesse got his first gut punch of the evening. He had anticipated taking some blows, but not this one, not so soon. Inside the elevator was a dazzling woman with yellow-green eyes and jet-black hair cut in a perfect wedge. The hair that fell over the light mocha skin of her left cheek made a crisp angular line from her delicate cleft chin to her bare collarbone. Her plush red mouth neither smiled nor frowned at the man getting into the elevator with her, though her nose twitched ever so slightly. She wore a tight, satiny champagne-colored gown that made her look like she was moving in the wind even as she stood motionless. There was a rope of diamonds around her long, tanned neck. Sprinkled in among the diamonds were blood rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.</p><p>&#x201c;Kayla,&#x201d; Jesse said as the door closed behind him. &#x201c;You look lovely.&#x201d; He bent and gave her an awkward kiss on the cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;Jess.&#x201d; She touched his cheek once and then quickly put her hand down by her side. &#x201c;You keep a portrait in your attic? You haven&#x2019;t aged a day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks. No portrait. Vic?&#x201d;</p><p>She let out an exasperated sigh. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s down at the bar already with the boys.&#x201d;</p><p>They rode the remainder of the way to the bar level in uncomfortable silence. Their story was an old one. Jesse had been dating Kayla for a few weeks after getting the bump up to the Dodgers&#x2019; triple-A team. She was a beautiful girl even then, if not the finely polished trophy she was now. They weren&#x2019;t too serious, but the sex had been ferocious and Jesse thought there might be a future for them together. That lasted only until a slow ground ball was hit in the right-side hole and was smothered by Jesse Stone&#x2019;s roommate, Vic Prado. Instead of getting the sure out at first, Prado got to his knees at the edge of the outfield grass and threw across his body to Jesse, who was just coming across second base. The runner went hard into Jesse, trying to take him out and prevent an accurate throw to first. Mission accomplished. He took Jesse out, all right: right out of a career. Jesse&#x2019;s throw was legless and awkward. He had no balance and crash-landed on the hard infield with the point of his right shoulder. Jesse&#x2019;s initial thought: <i>Did I get the runner at first?</i> His second: <i>I&#x2019;m screwed.</i> By the time he came back from the hospital in L.A., post-surgery, Kayla had switched roommates from the one whose future had recently passed to the one scheduled for a September call-up to the big club.</p><p>When the elevator car came to a halt, Jesse gestured for Kayla to exit first. As she did, she said, &#x201c;I still think about you, Jess,&#x201d; and left. He stood in place. Almost from the moment he had checked the yes box on the RSVP...</p></p><h2>The Amber Room: A Novel of Suspense</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A winner . . . combines the pace and style of&nbsp;Brown&#x2019;s <i>Da Vinci Code</i> and the densely plotted&nbsp;espionage of Daniel Silva&#x2019;s Gabriel Allon novels.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Florida Times-Union</i></b><br><br>Atlanta judge Rachel Cutler loves her job and her kids, but her life takes a dark turn when her father dies under strange circumstances, leaving behind clues to a secret about one of the greatest treasures ever made by man.

Nearly 2,000 Jews from that area died in the concentration camps, but even though everyone on Erikousa knew Savvas and his family were hiding on the island, no one ever gave them up, and the family survived the war.<br> <br>Years later, Yvette couldn&#x2019;t get the story of the Jewish tailor out of her head. She decided to track down the man&#x2019;s descendants&#x2014;and eventually found them in Israel. Their tearful reunion was proof to her that evil doesn&#x2019;t always win. But just days after she made the connection, her cousin&#x2019;s child was gunned down in a parking lot in Kansas, a victim of a Neo-Nazi out to inflict as much harm as he could. Despite her best hopes, she was forced to confront the fact that seventy years after the Nazis were defeated, remainders of their hateful legacy still linger today.<br> <br>As Yvette and her family wrestled with the tragedy in their own lives, the lessons she learned from the survivors of the Holocaust helped her confront and make sense of the present. In beautiful interweaving storylines, the past and present come together in a nuanced, heartfelt &#x201c;story of compassion and collective resistance&#x201d; with &#x201c;undeniable emotional power&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p><p>Yvette Manessis Corporon is a three-time Emmy Award&#x2013;winning writer, author, and producer.

His back was to me, but he was still awake. I knew he would be. We all were.<br> <br>Earlier that day we had gotten a call that didn&#x2019;t seem real. It still doesn&#x2019;t, and I imagine it never will. My 14-year-old nephew, Reat, and his grandfather, Bill, were dead.<br> <br>Bill and Reat had gone to the Jewish Community Campus in Overland Park, Kansas, so Reat could attend a singing audition. They were shot and killed by a white supremacist neo-Nazi as they exited their car. The man who killed them shouted &#x201c;Heil Hitler!&#x201d; when he was arrested and said he wanted to know what it felt like to kill Jews before he died. He murdered three beautiful people that day, none of whom were Jewish.<br> <br>I sat on the edge of Nico&#x2019;s bed and reached my hand out to stroke his hair. My sweet nine-year-old boy rolled over to face me, his big brown eyes brimming with tears. And then he spoke, breaking my heart for the second time that day.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sad, Mom,&#x201d; Nico said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. When you told me about our family and what they did, you told me the Nazis were gone and that the people were saved. How could this happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nico was right. I did tell him that the Nazis were gone. And I did tell him that the family was safe. I&#x2019;d thought they were. But then I was branded a liar that day, our family&#x2019;s history rewritten by a hate-filled man on a mission to kill Jews.<br> <br>Nico knew the story as well as I did. Again and again I&#x2019;d told him how during World War II, my Greek grandmother, my yia-yia, was one of a group of islanders who helped hide a Jewish tailor named Savvas and his family from the Nazis. Despite the risk, despite the danger, and despite the fact that they were told that anyone found helping Jews would be killed along with their entire families, not one person on our tiny Greek island gave up the secret of Savvas. Not one. Savvas and his girls were saved and they all survived.<br> <br>For the past several years, Nico had witnessed my personal journey, my search to find Savvas&#x2019;s family, the girls my yia-yia had risked everything for. After countless dead ends and disappointments, I had finally found them. They were a beautiful family, including five people who are alive today because of what happened on our tiny island 70 years ago. We had celebrated with the descendants of Savvas&#x2019;s family. We celebrated and cried, because they had survived; goodness had prevailed and the Nazis were gone. That was on Thursday, April 10, 2014.<br> <br>Three days later, on Sunday, April 13, 2014, we cried again, because Bill and Reat were dead and we realized that the Nazis weren&#x2019;t really gone after all.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Nico asked. &#x201c;How could this happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>How do you accept that tragic irony is a cruelty reserved not merely for Shakespearean plot twists?<br> <br>How do you admit to your son that monsters exist outside of fairy tales?<br> <br>How do you explain to a child something you can&#x2019;t understand yourself?</p><h2>The Story of Ruth: Twelve Moments in Every Woman&#39;s Life</h2><p>In this beautiful book best-selling author Joan Chittister and celebrated artist John August Swanson together reclaim the ancient story of Ruth as a model for contemporary women seeking a fully spiritual life.<br><br>In concert with Swanson's rich and evocative art, Chittister's graceful prose explores, through this powerful biblical story, a series of twelve defining moments in every woman's life &#x2015; moments of loss, change, transformation, aging, independence, respect, recognition, insight, empowerment, selfdefinition, invisibility, and fulfillment.<br><br>A lovely blend of art and text, The Story of Ruth offers inspiration for women seeking wholeness and presents compelling devotional images for eyes and mind alike.</p><p>Joan Chittister is executive director of Benetvision: AResource and Research Center for Contemporary Spirituality,Erie, Pennsylvania.

This creative and engaging book is in the highest Jewish tradition of reading 'between the lines' of scripture. . . Should be required reading for Christians and Jews, women and ? above all ? men."&nbsp;<b>Rosemary Luling Haughton</b><br> "Joan Chittister's reflections about loss and change, about isolation and empowerment, are both realistic and liberating. . . And John August Swanson's artworks are contemplative experiences in themselves ? quiet, yet glowing and vivid."&nbsp;<b>Michael Downey</b><br> "These pages shimmer. Lush, warm colors and patterns together with piercing, prophetic words summon the heart to behold an enduring image of fidelity. Look and listen ? long and lovingly ? to the story of Ruth and Naomi. And receive, once again, the gift of hope still on offer."&nbsp;<b><i>Spirit &amp; Life</i></b><br> "In twelve unusual chapters, Ruth is portrayed as the prototype of a 21st century 'Everywoman,' free, independent, and equal with all humankind. Complementing the text, twelve lovely paintings by John August Swanson illustrate the way Ruth wins her freedom and feminine independence. A beautiful book in every way, 'The Story of Ruth' is for treasuring and gift-giving."&nbsp;<b><i>Parade Magazine</i></b><br> "Writing a book that blends spirituality, inspiration and feminism is no easy feat, but Joan D. Chittister has accomplished it with rare sensitivity in&nbsp;<i>The Story of Ruth: Twelve Moments in Every Woman's Life</i>. Taking the biblical narrative of the young Moabite widow who followed her mother-in-law to a new land she relates the story to modern women's quest for independence, respect, empowerment and self-fulfillment. You can agree or not with the lessons she finds, but her analysis is thoughtful and free from treacly interpretations. The book is enhanced immeasurably by John August Swanson's biblical-style illustrations."&nbsp;<b><i>The Newark Star-Ledger</i></b><br> "Attractively illustrated by John August Swanson, 'Ruth' is 'part self-help book, part poetry,' with Chittister presenting a God interested and intent on transforming women. . . Though it's the lives of two Old Testament women we're examining, Chittister leaves no doubt about the relevance and practical application to modern women. Don't be surprised to find yourself lingering in those moments that apply to the season of your life. . . Chittister's style is like that of friends whose advice is therapy. No, they haven't got any degrees in counseling, but that's where our feet carry us when we need wise counsel."&nbsp;<b><i>Sisters Today</i></b><br> "This book is a treat on all fronts. As usual, Chittister is challenging and thought provoking as she uses Ruth to illustrate moments in a woman's life. But the illustrator, John August Swanson has it right in his Notes when he says, 'This is not only a woman's book. . . ' Swanson's colorful and detailed illustrations alone are worth the price of the book, but with the text the book becomes richer still."&nbsp;<b><i>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</i></b><br> "The ancient biblical tale of a woman who left everything she knew for love of &#x2014;of all things&#x2014;a mother-in-law is brought to contemporary relevance by author Joan D. Chittister, a Benedictine nun, and artist John August Swanson. The prose is arresting and the illustrations simple, brilliantly colored and striking enough for second and even third looks. . . This is an old favorite made more so with the retelling."&nbsp;<b><i>The Bible Today</i></b><br> "The biblical story of Ruth is the basis of these twelve reflections on issues facing every woman. . . The contents of each chapter are a mix of personal reflection on life experience and social concern. Swanson's colorful art enhances every page, and a full page drawing depicting a scene from the biblical story introduces each chapter. The talents of the author and the artist come together to produce a book of note. This will make a fine gift."&nbsp;<b><i>Lutheran Woman Today</i></b><br> "Occasionally one finds a book so powerful and beautiful that it needs to be purchased and shared with many people!&nbsp;<i>The Story of Ruth</i>&nbsp;is such a book."&nbsp;<b><i>Benedictines Magazine</i></b><br> "This beautiful book combines the best of many arts&#x2014;the script of the ancient writer, the insights of the modern feminist-theologian, the portrayal in color, line and form of the illustrator and the glow of vibrant inks on every page. . . This is a book to be savored and appreciated for its form and content. Never at a loss to create a stir in her readers' minds and hearts, Chittister has outdone herself in&nbsp;<i>The Story of Ruth</i>."&nbsp;<b><i>Society for Old Testament Study Booklist</i></b><br> "This book combines Catholic spirituality and modern art to produce a charming and insightful account of twelve key moments in the lives of two biblical women, Ruth and Naomi, who are seen to function as 'metaphors' for all women."&nbsp;<b>Barbara Brown Taylor</b><br> "With characteristic wit and spitfire, Joan Chittister tells the story of Ruth for anyone challenged by loss, change, aging, or invisibility. Basing her reflections on the lives of two marginal biblical women, she reveals their central roles as mothers of faith and dares all their descendants ? both daughters and sons ? to follow their lead."&nbsp;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> "The best book on Ruth thus far may be Joan Chittister's creative, gorgeously illustrated exploration of the famous Moabitess as archetype for all women.&nbsp;<i>The Story of Ruth: Twelve Moments in Every Woman's Life</i>&nbsp;shows how Ruth's journey through loss, change, transformation, aging, independence, respect, recognition, insight, empowerment, self-definition, invisibility and fulfillment mirrors similar stages in many women's lives. . . The text's perceptive, piercing truths are complemented by stunning full-color artwork by John August Swanson."&nbsp;<b><i>The Living Church</i></b><br> "A beautifully illustrated and printed book on the Book of Ruth with commentary by well-known spiritual writer Joan Chittister on how Ruth's story speaks to women of today in their own quest for spiritual wholeness."</p><h2>Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files 02 (2)</h2><p>Judge Dredd is judge, jury and executioner; a merciless far-future lawman delivering justice with an iron fist on the mean streets of Mega-City One.

You wake to the sound of a rooster&#39;s crow, instead of an alarm clock and the school bus. Your afternoon snack is a tasty bug plucked from the sky, instead of an apple. And rather than kicking a soccer ball across a field, you kick a homemade ball of rags down a dusty road. But despite this, things aren&#39;t that different for a Kenyan child than they would be for an American kid, are they? With so much going on around you, it&#39;s just as easy to forget what your mama asked you to do!</p><p><b>Kelly Cunnane</b> lived in Africa for many years but now resides in Beals, Maine.

PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Through vivid, descriptive text that highlights the Kenyan countryside and culture, this story about one day in the life of a Kalenjin boy unfolds. Roosters crow, and you wake one morning in the green hills of Africa, sun lemon bright over eucalyptus trees full of doves. The boy's primary chore is to take his grandfather's cows to the pasture and watch them carefully. However, once he gets them there, he slips away to see who else is awake. From then on, he keeps getting distracted by one thing or another. When he finally looks to where the cows should be, they are not there. His expression is forlorn as he ponders, Why did you wander? Why didn't you stay and do the job Mama gave you today? When he meets his grandfather leading the cows on the path home&#x2013;something he should have been doing&#x2013;the youngster is contrite. Grandfather simply hands him back his cow switch and says, <i>Twende nyumbani sasa</i>&#x2013;Let's go home now. The brilliant, colorful, and humorous illustrations stand out against the white backgrounds and are large enough for group viewing. A gentle story about family, responsibility, and a curious little boy.<i>&#x2013;Mary N.

Epstein, University of Chicago).<br><br>Libertarianism&#x2014;the philosophy of personal and economic freedom&#x2014;has deep roots in Western civilization and in American history, and it&#x2019;s growing stronger. Two long wars, chronic deficits, the financial crisis, the costly drug war, the campaigns of Ron Paul and Rand Paul, the growth of executive power under Presidents Bush and Obama, and the revelations about NSA abuses have pushed millions more Americans in a libertarian direction. <i>Libertarianism: A Primer</i>, by David Boaz, the longtime executive vice president of the Cato Institute, continues to be the best available guide to the history, ideas, and growth of this increasingly important political movement&#x2014;and now it has been updated throughout and with a new title: <i>The Libertarian Mind</i>. <br> <br>Boaz has updated the book with new information on the threat of government surveillance; the policies that led up to and stemmed from the 2008 financial crisis; corruption in Washington; and the unsustainable welfare state. <i>The Libertarian Mind</i> is the ultimate resource for the current, burgeoning libertarian movement.</p><p>David Boaz is executive vice president of the Cato Institute.

It&#x2019;s the philosophy that has in different forms inspired people throughout history who fought for freedom, dignity, and individual rights&#x2014;the early advocates of religious tolerance, the opponents of absolute monarchy, the American revolutionaries, the abolitionists, antiwar and anti-imperialist advocates, opponents of National Socialism and communism.<br> <br>Libertarians believe in the presumption of liberty. That is, libertarians believe people ought to be free to live as they choose unless advocates of coercion can make a compelling case. It&#x2019;s the exercise of power, not the exercise of freedom, that requires justification. If we followed the presumption of liberty, our lives would be freer, more prosperous, and more satisfying.<br> <br>The burden of proof ought to be on those who want to limit our freedom.<br> <br>We should be free to live our lives as we choose so long as we respect the equal rights of others. The presumption of liberty should be as strong as the presumption of innocence in a criminal trial, for the same reason. Just as you can&#x2019;t prove your innocence of all possible charges against you, you cannot justify all of the ways in which you should be allowed to act.<br> <br>But too often we&#x2019;re told that we have to justify each exercise of our freedom. Want to add a room onto your house? Smoke marijuana? Own a gun? Surf the Internet in privacy? Open a new taxi company? Prove that you need such a freedom.<br> <br>When New York mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to impose a ban on sodas larger than sixteen ounces, nanny-state activists proclaimed that &#x201c;no one needs a large soda.&#x201d; Maybe not, but what if they want one? Don&#x2019;t people have a right to choose what they eat and drink? Former senator Richard Lugar said that he wanted to ban certain firearms &#x201c;for which I see no legitimate social purpose.&#x201d; What other products might not have a &#x201c;legitimate social purpose&#x201d;&#x2014;cigarettes? Electric toothbrushes? Light beer? Politicians&#x2019; autobiographies? In a free society politicians and political majorities shouldn&#x2019;t be arbiters of what can be sold by willing sellers to willing buyers.<br> <br>Similarly, defenders of massive surveillance of our phone calls and web surfing demand that we make the case for our freedom and privacy. They are wrong. The burden of proof should be on those who would compile sweeping databases of our activities. Liberty should be the presumption. Restrictions on liberty need justification.<br> <br>We do get exercised about limits on our freedom, but not often enough. Just look at the restrictions government has imposed on us. Government takes as much as half the money we earn. It tells us where to send our children to school and how to save for retirement. It tells us what we may eat, drink, and smoke. It tells us whether we may marry the person we love.<br> <br>Fortunately, we do still have a lot of freedom, in the United States and in more and more parts of the world.<br> <br>Sometimes we forget just how much of our life is in fact free. We make thousands of choices every day, engage in thousands of interactions with others, without any coercion. We don&#x2019;t ask Congress where we should work. We don&#x2019;t expect the police to get our kids out of bed in the morning. We don&#x2019;t call the mayor to fix our cars. We don&#x2019;t go to city hall to buy a new computer. We don&#x2019;t want the federal bureaucracy to write books, make movies, compose music, or provide us with a place to worship. Freedom has a central place in our lives, and every day people create peace and order without central direction.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not easy to define freedom. The author Leonard Read said, &#x201c;Freedom is the absence of man-concocted restraints against the release of creative energy.&#x201d; The Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek referred to &#x201c;a state in which each can use his knowledge for his purpose&#x201d; and also to &#x201c;the possibility of a person&#x2019;s acting according to his own decisions and plans, in contrast to the position of one who was irrevocably subject to the will of another, who by arbitrary decision could coerce him to act or not to act in specific ways.&#x201d; Perhaps it&#x2019;s best to understand freedom as the absence of physical force or the threat of physical force. John Locke offered this definition of freedom under the rule of law:<br> <br>[T]he end of Law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge Freedom: For in all the states of created beings capable of Laws, where there is no Law, there is no Freedom: For Liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others which cannot be, where there is no Law: But Freedom is not, as we are told, A Liberty for every Man to do what he lists: (For who could be free, when every other Man&#x2019;s Humour might domineer over him?) But a Liberty to dispose, and order, as he lists, his Persons, Actions, Possessions, and his whole Property, within the Allowance of those Laws under which he is; and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary Will of another, but freely follow his own.<br> <br>That is, a free person is not &#x201c;subject to the arbitrary will of another&#x201d; and is free to do as he chooses with his own person and property. But you can have those freedoms only when the law protects your freedom and everyone else&#x2019;s.<br> <br>However we define freedom, we can certainly recognize aspects of it. Freedom means respecting the moral autonomy of each person, seeing each person as the owner of his or her own life, and each free to make the important decisions about his life.<br> <br>Freedom allows each of us to define the meaning of life, to define what&#x2019;s important to us.<br> <br>And thus each of us should be free to think, to speak, to write, to paint, to create, to marry, to eat and drink and smoke, to start and run a business, to associate with others as we choose. When we are free, we can construct our lives as we see fit.<br> <br>The social consequences of freedom are equally desirable. Freedom leads to social harmony. We have less conflict when we have fewer specific commands and prohibitions about how we should live&#x2014;in terms of class or caste, religion, dress, lifestyle, or schools&#x2014;as we&#x2019;ll see throughout this book.<br> <br>Economic freedom means that people are free to produce and to exchange with others. Freely negotiated and agreed-upon prices carry information throughout the economy about what people want and what can be done more efficiently. For an economic order to function, prices must be free to tell the truth. A free economy gives people incentives to invent, innovate, and produce more goods and services for the whole society. That means more satisfaction of more wants, more economic growth, and a higher standard of living for everyone.<br> <br>That process has taken us in barely 250 years of economic freedom from the backbreaking labor and short life expectancy that were the natural lot of mankind since time immemorial to the abundance we see around us today in more and more parts of the world (though not yet enough of the world).<br> <br>Not everyone realizes just how poor the world was for so long. The living standard we enjoy today did not build steadily over the centuries. In fact, average GDP per capita&#x2014;the standard of living of the average person in the world&#x2014;was essentially stagnant from the year 0, or maybe even from ten thousand years before that, until around 1700 in northern Europe. And then a wealth explosion happened: Real income per person grew by a factor of ten, twenty, maybe even one hundred in the space of three centuries, first in northwestern Europe and the United States and then in more parts of the world. This chart is based on the work of the economic historian Angus Maddison.<br><br>China and Western Europe GDP per capita<br>1000 CE &#x2013; 2003 CE<br> <br><br><br>What&#x2019;s changed to make us so much wealthier? Freedom. A political system of liberty gives us the opportunity to use our talents and to cooperate with others to create and produce, with the help of a few simple institutions that protect our rights. And those simple institutions&#x2014;property rights, the rule of law, a prohibition on the initiation of force&#x2014;make possible invention, innovation, and progress in commerce, technology, and styles of living. When libertarians defend limited government, we are defending freedom and the progress it brings.<br> WHAT IS LIBERTARIANISM?<p></p> <br>Libertarianism is the view that each person has the right to live his life in any way he chooses so long as he respects the equal rights of others. (Throughout this book I use the traditional English &#x201c;he&#x201d; and &#x201c;his&#x201d; to refer to all individuals, male and female; unless the context indicates otherwise, &#x201c;he&#x201d; and &#x201c;his&#x201d; should be understood to refer to both men and women.) Libertarians defend each person&#x2019;s right to life, liberty, and property&#x2014;rights that people possess naturally, before governments are instituted. In the libertarian view, all human relationships should be voluntary; the only actions that should be forbidden by law are those that involve the initiation of force against those who have not themselves used force&#x2014;actions such as murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, and fraud.<br> <br>Most people habitually believe in and live by that code of ethics. We don&#x2019;t hit people, break down their doors, take their money by force, or imprison them if they live peacefully in ways that we don&#x2019;t like. Libertarians believe this code should be applied consistently&#x2014;and specifically, that it should be applied to actions by governments as well as by individuals. Governments should exist to protect rights, to protect us from others who might use force against us. For most libertarians, that means police to prevent crime and arrest criminals, courts to settle disputes and punish wrongdoers, and national defense against external threats. When governments use force against people who have not violated the rights of others, then governments themselves become rights violators. Thus libertarians condemn such government actions as censorship, the draft, price controls, confiscation of property, and intrusion into our personal and economic lives.<br> <br>Put so starkly, the libertarian vision may sound otherworldly, like a doctrine for a universe of angels that never was and never will be. Surely, in today&#x2019;s messy and often unpleasant world, government must do a great deal? But here&#x2019;s the surprise: The answer is no. In fact, the more messy and modern the world, the better libertarianism works, especially when compared with monarchy, dictatorship, and even postwar Western welfare-statism. The political awakening in America today is first and foremost the realization that libertarianism is not a relic of the past. It is a philosophy&#x2014;more, a pragmatic plan&#x2014;for the future. In American politics it is the leading edge&#x2014;not a backlash, but a vanguard.<br> <br>Government is serious business. But some deep insights into government have been expressed by comic writers, including P. J. O&#x2019;Rourke, who summed up his political philosophy this way: &#x201c;Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.&#x201d; Thomas Paine&#x2019;s view of government echoes in Dave Barry&#x2019;s explanation: &#x201c;The best way to understand this whole issue is to look at what the government does: it takes money from some people, keeps a bunch of it, and gives the rest to other people.&#x201d;<br> <br>In short, we might say: Libertarianism is the idea that adult individuals have the right and the responsibility to make the important decisions about their own lives.<br> THE LIBERTARIAN SURGE<p></p> <br>Libertarianism is an old idea in America and elsewhere, as I&#x2019;ll discuss more in chapter 2, but there&#x2019;s been a remarkable surge in libertarian thinking lately. A series of CNN polls found that total support for a combination of libertarian positions had risen 30 percent between 2002 and 2012. Journalists now talk about a libertarian faction in Congress and in the electorate. Libertarian organizations are booming.<br> <br>And no wonder. In the past few years politicians have given us many reasons to doubt the wisdom and efficacy of big, activist government. Endless wars. Economic collapse. Corporate bailouts. The highest government spending and national debt ever. An unimaginable level of spying on citizens.<br> <br>There are many kinds of &#x201c;libertarians,&#x201d; of course. Some are people who might describe themselves as &#x201c;fiscally conservative and socially liberal,&#x201d; or say they want the government &#x201c;out of my pocketbook and out of my bedroom.&#x201d; Some believe in the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence and want the government to remain within the limits of the Constitution. Some just have an instinctive belief in freedom or an instinctive aversion to being told what to do. Some are admirers of Dr. Ron Paul and his son, Senator Rand Paul, and their campaigns against war, government spending, the surveillance state, and the Federal Reserve. Some like the writings of Thomas Jefferson or John Stuart Mill. Some have studied economics. Some have noticed that war, prohibition, cronyism, racial and religious discrimination, protectionism, central planning, welfare, taxes, and government spending have deleterious effects. Some are so radical they think all goods and services could be provided without a state. In this book I welcome all those people to the libertarian cause. When I talk about libertarian ideas, I&#x2019;ll generally be referring to the central arguments that have been developed by thinkers from John Locke and Adam Smith to F. A.

Harriman organized a most unusual summer voyage to the wilds of Alaska: He converted a steamship into a luxury "floating university," populated by some of America's best and brightest scientists and writers, including the anti-capitalist eco-prophet John Muir. Those aboard encountered a land of immeasurable beauty and impending environmental calamity.

Hart Merriam. At age forty-three, Merriam had already been practicing science seriously for three decades, dating back to some unauthorized taxidermy performed on his sister's dead cat. In 1872, on summer break from high school, he had served as naturalist on an expedition to America's newly christened Yellowstone National Park and published his findings in a fifty-page government report. He had since earned and abandoned an MD degree, cofounded the National Geographic Society, and identified dozens of bird and mammal species.<br><br> Merriam did not, however, recognize the name of the mysterious stranger who'd interrupted his typically hectic workday. Edward H. Harriman, as any close observer of Wall Street would have known, was on the verge of becoming one of the most famous-and, in the trust-busting years to come, infamous-entrepreneurs of the late Gilded Age. In the years prior to setting foot in Merriam's office at the U.S. Division of Biological Survey, at 14th and Independence, Harriman had taken control of the underperforming Union Pacific Railroad. The previous summer, the new chief executive had personally inspected more than six thousand miles of track, examining "every poor tie, blistered rail, and loose bolt," according to one superintendent. The complete modernization Harriman ordered for the Union Pacific had left his railroad in rapidly improving shape and its chief executive physically exhausted. For the summer of 1899, Harriman's physician-who joined him in Merriam's office-was ordering him to take a sabbatical.<br><br> Harriman, whose quicksilver mind terrified his underlings and allowed him to see opportunities invisible to others, had conceived something much more ambitious than a couple of months of tennis and lemonade at his country estate. His plan was to outfit a large steamship as his private yacht and survey the coast of Alaska. In the previous fifteen years, it had become possible to book package tours up the Inside Passage, as the waterways of the British Columbia coast and Alaska panhandle had come to be known. A steady flow of well-to-do excursioners had been lured by newspaper and magazine stories raving about Alaska's glaciers. One particularly adventurous writer had done more than all others combined to promote the territory's frozen wonders: John Muir.<br><br> Harriman was bringing along his wife and children, as well as a few guests and an ample crew, but his ship had the capacity to carry many more. He sought Merriam's help in rounding up a team of America's top experts in the natural sciences to accompany them. "He thought that there should be two men of recognized ability in each department," Merriam later recalled. "Two zoologists, two botanists, two geologists and so on." Harriman expected to depart from Seattle in just two months.<br><br> Harriman's rough itinerary combined familiar elements of the newly fashionable northern Grand Tour with exploration into points unknown. His steamship would sail up the Inside Passage and visit its best-known spots: lawless Wrangell; Skagway, epicenter of the Klondike Gold Rush; the old Russian capital, Sitka; and Glacier Bay, perhaps the biggest draw of all, thanks to the ecstatic nature rhapsodies that Muir published in America's most popular magazines. But one of the secrets to Harriman's success was ignoring limits set by others. His Alaska course would extend thousands of miles further, continuing west toward the Bering Sea, scouting Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, the Aleutians, and beyond, obscure places where large swaths of territory were labeled unknown on maps and scientific discoveries were waiting for anyone who stepped on shore. Thanks to railroad men like Harriman, the wild American West had been all but subdued in less than a hundred years. In 1805, Lewis and Clark had witnessed herds of buffalo so large their movements shook the ground. By 1899, that same species faced extinction. The true American frontier now lay in the wilderness to the north. As the historian Maury Klein puts it, "Harriman's idea of rest was to organize, underwrite, and direct what became the last major scientific expedition of the nineteenth century."<br><br> Seated in his office, Merriam was polite but dubious about Harriman's offer. Whoever had steered Harriman to Merriam had chosen wisely, though. The scientist, son of a congressman, was exceedingly well connected. He made quick inquiries, which confirmed that the railroad man was not only serious but probably incapable of joking. Cartoonists delighted in depicting Merriam, who wore round spectacles and combed his hair into a tall pouf, as an administrative owl. He was wise enough to see that he might have stumbled across the most elusive of creatures: a scientific expedition with no fixed budget. When Harriman visited Merriam's home that night and insisted that in addition to covering all costs he would allow the team Merriam selected free rein to conduct their own research, Merriam was convinced that Harriman's northbound Noah's Ark was no rich man's boondoggle.<br><br> "To be a member of it would be the event of a lifetime," he realized.<br><br> Chapter Two<br><br> All Points North<br><br> New York City<br><br> Next to the cluttered desk in my office, I keep a small collection of manila folders labeled with the names of destinations I would like to write about one day. Inside each folder are scraps of paper-bar napkins covered in semi-legible hieroglyphics and yellowed newspaper clippings pertaining to a particular place. In the folder marked alaska, there's a piece of hotel stationery on which I scribbled something an Alaskan friend once told me. Three basic types of people live in Alaska, he said. There are the Native Alaskans, who've been there since time immemorial. There are people who have come north running toward something, usually a chance to do something unpleasant to make a lot of money quickly, such as gutting fish twelve hours a day or operating a welding torch in minus-forty-degree temperatures. And there are those who are running away from something, like a bad marriage or fluoridated water.<br><br> Travel writing is an odd and pleasant way to make a living, one that has enabled me to fast-forward to the sort of life people profiled in Forbes often anticipate once they've made a Harriman-worthy fortune. I wander the world meeting interesting people; I write books; and when not on the road, I spend so much time around the house that my children sometimes feel obligated to tell friends that I really do have a job. Over the years, I have learned that the most interesting questions to answer about a place are rarely the most obvious ones: where to go, when to do so, what to eat, who to go with, or even how to get there. The essential question about travel is: Why? Perhaps you've dreamed of Kenya ever since seeing Out of Africa as a child, or want to meet your distant relatives in Ireland, or long to see a lemur in the wild. A journey away from something-work, stress, societal norms that frown on drinking before 10:00 a.m.-is a vacation. A journey toward something, a trip with an objective, is an expedition. There are a handful of spectacular places I've put off visiting (and writing about) for years because I never found a good enough reason to go. Until recently, Alaska was one of them.<br><br> Outside of my professional travel obligations, I like a plain old relaxing vacation as much as anyone, and was in the midst of one not long ago when I found myself in the slightly seedy Seattle neighborhood of Pioneer Square, staring up at a totem pole. The presence of a totem pole at a busy intersection in Seattle wasn't especially noteworthy-they're only marginally less common than stoplights-though I was surprised to encounter standing beneath this one a friendly young U.S. national park ranger in his Smokey Bear hat. The pole, he enthusiastically informed me, was actually a duplicate. The original had been obtained in 1899 by a group of prominent local business leaders who'd sailed north to Alaska's Inside Passage to steal one from a Native village. The Pioneer Square pole thieves seem to have stolen their idea, too, the ranger went on. They'd been inspired by the ballyhooed return to Seattle of the Harriman Expedition.<br><br> As it happens, one of the qualifications of my unusual job is knowing a thing or two about the history of exploration. An entire bookcase in my office is crammed with accounts of journeys to the far corners of the earth. The existence of the Harriman Expedition was news to me, though, a gap in my knowledge that grew into embarrassment once I got a look at the league of extraordinary gentlemen Hart Merriam assembled in 1899. His selections had participated in almost every important American expedition since the Civil War. The obvious first choice was William Healey Dall, the dean of Alaskan explorers, who'd begun visiting the northern wilderness when it was still Russian and had written Alaska and Its Resources, perhaps the most influential book ever published on the territory. Grove Karl Gilbert, veteran of multiple Rocky Mountain campaigns, was thought by many to be the greatest American geologist who ever lived. Henry Gannett's brilliant innovations in geography led him to be known as "the Father of American Map Making." George Bird Grinnell, editor of the influential Forest and Stream magazine, had founded the Audubon Society and was arguably the most respected outdoorsman in the country. Some expeditioners were already good friends. Others knew one another only by reputation. Everyone knew Merriam.<br><br> Not all prospective members were academic specialists. Aside from taking the rest his doctor had prescribed, Harriman seemed to have two primary goals for his summer in Alaska. He wished to return from his adventures with a trophy bear, so two taxidermists and a scout were hired to accompany the group. Harriman also, in the Carnegie-esque spirit of the age, hoped to render a philanthropic service by enabling scientists in various fields to survey the wonders of Alaska, enlarge their collections of specimens, and share their findings with an American public that had developed a passion for the natural history museums that were proliferating around the country. Merriam expanded the team to include three artists and a young photographer, Edward S. Curtis, who had guided Merriam and Grinnell to safety after they'd gotten lost while hiking on Mount Rainier in 1898. Rounding out the roster was a pair of America's best-known authors in a genre-nature writing-that was growing in popularity as America's wilderness vanished. One was John Burroughs, famous for his bestselling essays on birds and flowers, signed on to write the expedition's official history.<br><br> The second author was both an obvious invitee and a reluctant one. John Muir was perhaps America's leading writer on the relatively new subject of wilderness protection, a movement that within a few years would come to be known as conservation. He had visited Alaska six times and was generally acknowledged as the top expert on its glaciers. His 1879 canoe trip through the Inside Passage is one of the most famous voyages in American exploration. (Muir's first encounter with Glacier Bay is the heart of his classic Travels in Alaska, a copy of which I did have in my office bookcase.) He had also founded the Sierra Club, to defend California's dwindling wild places against men like Harriman, practitioners of what Muir called "gobble gobble economics." Unfamiliar with Harriman, and perplexed by his unusual offer, Muir dragged his feet until his friend Merriam convinced him that the ship would be making stops in Alaskan locations that even Muir had yet to explore.<br><br> With his legacy in mind, Harriman paid Hart Merriam to edit what became twelve beautifully printed volumes of writings and photographs by the expedition members. Taken as a whole, the Harriman Alaska Series serves as a sepia snapshot of Alaska's natural riches in 1899: bears and whales and fjords and snowcapped peaks. Most striking of all, due largely to Muir's influence, are the hundreds of glaciers, many newly discovered and each as distinct in words and pictures as a snowflake under a microscope.<br><br> Since 1867, when the United States purchased the half million square miles of what had been called "Russian America," the territory has had a split personality. Alaska is the Last Frontier, land of sublime wild beauty. It is also, in the words of author and eco-activist Edward Abbey, "the last pork chop," a natural larder waiting to be raided. Alaska has been shaped by three gold rushes, each of which left behind a fundamentally different place. The first was the soft gold rush of fur, starting in the mid-eighteenth century, which opened the Great Land to the ships of Europe's most powerful nations. The second was the hard gold rush of the 1890s, which drew thousands of new non-Native residents north for the first time. The scientists assembled by Hart Merriam witnessed the unintended consequences of unregulated exploitation in Alaska-species driven to extinction, pristine lands and waters contaminated, Native cultures destroyed-and recorded these effects in the Harriman Alaska Series as well.<br><br> Alaska's third and biggest boom was the liquid gold rush that began with the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the 1970s. Around the time I learned of the Harriman Expedition's existence, news stories began to report that, after nearly forty fat years, Alaska's third rush was reaching a crisis point just as its others had. The state's oil reserves were dwindling, and the price per barrel had collapsed, crippling the regional economy. Alaska faced a difficult choice: double down and open protected wilderness areas for drilling, which climate scientists argued was the opposite of what should be done in light of alarming warming trends; or move on to the Next Big Thing, whatever that might be, as the state always had.<br><br> It seemed I finally had my reason to visit Alaska-my answer to the question "Why?" I could follow in the Harriman Expedition's wake and compare what Hart Merriam's all-star team of experts had recorded with what was happening now. How to do so was another matter. Alaska is essentially a small continent: big enough to hold Texas, California, and Montana (the second-, third-, and fourth-largest states) and still have room left over for New England, Hawaii, and a couple of metropolises. It contains seven mountain ranges and ten peaks taller than any in the Lower 48. Its waterfront accounts for half of all coast in the United States. Louisiana has four times as many miles of paved roads. Except for a few of the larger cities and towns, most places in Alaska-and almost every place visited by the Harriman Expedition-can be reached only by boat or airplane. You can't even drive to Juneau, the state capital.<br><br> Because of these obstacles, Alaska has always been as much a seafaring culture as Polynesia. The great majority of its recreational visitors today make the journey the same way they would have in 1899: on ships. Each summer a million cruise ship passengers make the same scenery hajj as the Harriman Expedition. The most recent data I could find showed the Inside Passage had catapulted over Las Vegas and Orlando to become America's number-one tourist destination.</p><h2>Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World</h2><p>In this compelling history of the United Fruit Company, <i>Financial Times</i> writer Peter Chapman weaves a dramatic tale of big business, deceit, and violence, exploring the origins of arguably one of the most controversial global corporations ever, and the ways in which their pioneering example set the precedent for the institutionalized greed of today&#x2019;s multinational companies.<br>The story has its source in United Fruit&#x2019;s nineteenth-century beginnings in the jungles of Costa Rica. What follows is a damning examination of the company&#x2019;s policies: from the marketing of the banana as the first fast food, to the company&#x2019;s involvement in an invasion of Honduras, a massacre in Colombia, and a bloody coup in Guatemala. Along the way the company fostered covert links with U.S. power brokers such as Richard Nixon and CIA operative Howard Hunt, manipulated the press in new, and stoked the revolutionary ire of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.<br>From the exploited banana republics of Central America to the concrete jungle of New York City, Peter Chapman&#x2019;s <i>Bananas</i> is a lively and insightful cultural history of the coveted yellow fruit, as well as a gripping narrative about the infamous rise and fall of the United Fruit Company.</p><p><p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley</p><p>A climactic scene in Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez's masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude, takes place during a strike by Colombian banana workers when armed forces acting at the behest of "the banana company" herd 3,000 people into the town square of Macondo and open fire on them: </p><p>"The captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once. But it all seemed like a farce. It was as if the machine guns had been loaded with caps, because their panting rattle could be heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen, but not the slightest reaction was perceived, not a cry, not even a sigh among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instantaneous invulnerability. Suddenly, on one side of the station, a cry of death tore open the enchantment: 'Aaaagh, Mother'. . . . They were penned in, swirling about in a gigantic whirlwind that little by little was being reduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically being cut off all around like an onion being peeled by the insatiable and methodical shears of the machine guns." </p><p>The only survivor is a boy, who lives to tell "with precise and convincing details how the army had machine-gunned more than three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies into a two-hundred-car train and threw them into the sea." The terrible scene is fiction, but it is based in fact; indeed, Living to Tell the Tale is the title Garc�a M�rquez gave to his memoir, published in 2003. In December 1928, Colombian Army troops, acting in the interests of the United Fruit Company, opened fire on striking workers in the town of Ci�naga, near the author's native town, Aracataca. He was only a few months old at the time, but the story of the massacre was told over and over and worked its way into the core of his memory, just as stories of the Civil War became central to the consciousness of William Faulkner. </p><p>Garc�a M�rquez significantly overstated the number of dead -- the count has long been in dispute, with estimates ranging from 47 to 2,000 -- but he in no way underplayed the importance of the slaughter in 20th-century Latin American history. In the minds of millions, it came to symbolize the tyrannical role of United Fruit in the region and to cast the company as the leading actor in what came to be known as "Yankee imperialism" in "banana republics." Though many other depredations were committed by or in the name of United Fruit, which was commonly known as El Pulpo, "the octopus," this one quickly entered Latin America's psyche and has remained there ever since. </p><p>Peter Chapman, in this once-over-very-lightly history of United Fruit, gives the massacre only a few paragraphs. This is scarcely surprising in the context of the rest of the book, which can be called a work of history only in the most permissive sense of the term, but it's very surprising in the context of Chapman's determination to bash United Fruit -- and by extension the United States -- at every turn. Bananas -- in England it was published as Jungle Capitalists: A Story of Globalisation, Greed and Revolution -- is basically a rant, so one would think that the bloodbath in Ci�naga would have inspired him to heights of indignation, yet his description of it barely rides above the perfunctory. </p><p>Chapman is a British journalist who has covered Latin America in print and on air, and now writes for the Financial Times, including a blog about sports. His previous book, The Goalkeeper's History of Britain, was well-received, which makes the shortcomings of Bananas all the more disappointing and unexpected -- especially its prose, which is utterly lifeless, even when Chapman attempts to flay United Fruit and the many other malefactors who populate these pages. </p><p>United Fruit, Chapman claims, "set the template for capitalism, the first of the modern multi-nationals." It "started with a few bananas grown at the side of a railway line and became a global power." It "was greedy and controlled millions of acres of land, only a relatively small part of which it used. In countries of many landless small farmers, it kept the rest to keep out competitors and for a 'rainy day.' In and around its plantations it had fifteen hundred miles of railways, a good number of which its host countries built and paid for." Its "Great White Fleet of refrigerated ships, 'reefers', comprised the world's largest private navy." Et cetera. Chapman's determination to tar United Fruit with the brush of multinational rapaciousness knows no end: </p><p>"Like multi-national companies today, United Fruit made alliances when and where it could to survive. It sought out malleable elements: politicians with whom it could cut a deal and presidents-in-exile awaiting their call to sail back to power. United Fruit might even help find a boat. Its efforts showed that as long as it did not unduly offend the contemporary mores of its home base, then it could probably get away with much overseas. Its levels of bribery in Honduras in the 1920s did prompt a debate in the US Congress, which concluded that that was the way business was done in such parts of the world." </p><p>The company came into being in March 1899, under the leadership of Andrew Preston as president and Minor Keith as vice-president, but it was Keith who really ran this "brooding presence across six lands: Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic." Others eventually were absorbed in its grasp, most notably Honduras, where a military coup in 1911 -- engineered by United Fruit with the complicity of the United States -- brought into power a government friendly to the company's interests and established "conspiracy and violence" as important weapons in its control of the region. </p><p>All of this is beyond dispute, though whether Chapman has got all the details right must be left to scholars of Latin American history. United Fruit had much to do with introducing "banana republic" and "gunboat diplomacy" into the English language, and even more to do with establishing many Latin American countries as client states that did the company's, and Washington's, bidding. It isn't a pretty story, and the persistent success of left-wing and populist demagogues in Latin America leaves no doubt that the combination of United Fruit's greed and Washington's ill-considered policies established anti-Americanism as a powerful political force south of the border. Only now, as Washington reaches south with free-trade agreements, does much of Latin America look north with more friendly eyes, but the myopia of the present Congress with regard to these agreements puts that in jeopardy. There is ample reason to fear that Hugo Ch�vez is not the last of his breed. </p><p>In this sense, Chapman gets it more or less right. But his arguments about United Fruit and multinational corporations are shakier. For one thing, United Fruit was unable to sustain its empire. Eventually it was brought down by mismanagement, antitrust actions, competition, changed political circumstances here and to the south, and diseased bananas. Its successor, Chiquita, is by Chapman's admission no more than a "surviving remnant." United Fruit may have been an international corporate monopoly for a long time, but eventually it collapsed, which should serve as an object lesson in the vulnerability of businesses that operate in lawless and wholly self-serving ways. </p><p>Beyond that, Chapman skips too lightly over the difference in international business then and now. To be sure there still are companies that exploit the human and natural resources of foreign countries, especially in the Third World, and that use lobbying and political contributions for highly questionable ends. That, to paraphrase Chapman, is the way business is done in this and other parts of the world, an unpleasant but inescapable reality. But the multinationals aren't all malevolent, and they must answer to more stringent laws than United Fruit ever faced. Contrary to what Chapman would have us believe, there aren't any United Fruits today, which isn't an apology for the multinationals but a simple statement of fact. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

But is it a theology that should last? Roger Olson suggests that Calvinism, also commonly known as Reformed theology, holds an unwarranted place in our list of accepted theologies. In Against Calvinism, readers will find scholarly arguments explaining why Calvinist theology is incorrect and how it affects God&#x2019;s reputation. Olson draws on a variety of sources, including Scripture, reason, tradition, and experience, to support his critique of Calvinism and the more historically rich, biblically faithful alternative theologies he proposes. Addressing what many evangelical Christians are concerned about today&#x2015;so-called &#x201c;new Calvinism,&#x201d; a movement embraced by a generation labeled as &#x201c;young, restless, Reformed&#x201d; &#x2015;Against Calvinism is the only book of its kind to offer objections from a non-Calvinist perspective to the current wave of Calvinism among Christian youth. As a companion to Michael Horton&#x2019;s For Calvinism, readers will be able to compare contrasting perspectives and form their own opinions on the merits and weaknesses of Calvinism.</p></p><p><p>Roger E.

He lives in New York City and is tall for no reason.<b>TODAY</b><br> <b>MONDAY, NOVEMBER 20TH, 2016</b><br> You&#x2019;re still alive in alternate universes, Theo, but I live in the real world, where this morning you&#x2019;re having an open-casket funeral. I know you&#x2019;re out there, listening. And you should know I&#x2019;m really pissed because you swore you would never die and yet here we are. It hurts even more because this isn&#x2019;t the first promise you&#x2019;ve broken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll break down the details of this promise again. You made it last August. Trust me when I say I&#x2019;m not talking down to you as I recall this memory, and many others, in great detail. I doubt it&#x2019;ll even surprise you since we always joked about how your brain worked in funny ways. You knew enough meaningless trivia to fill notebooks, but you occasionally slipped on the bigger things, like my birthday this year (May 17th, not the 18th), and you never kept your night classes straight even though I got you a cool planner with zombies on the cover (which you-know-who probably forced you to throw out). I just want you to remember things the way I do. And if bringing up the past annoys you now&#x2014;as I know it did when you left New York for California&#x2014;know that I&#x2019;m sorry, but please don&#x2019;t be mad at me for reliving all of it. History is all you left me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made promises to each other on the day I broke up with you so you could do your thing out there in Santa Monica without me holding you back. Some of those promises took bad turns but weren&#x2019;t broken, like how I said I&#x2019;d never hate you even though you gave me enough reasons to, or how you never stopped being my friend even when your boyfriend asked you to. But on the day we were walking to the post office with Wade to ship your boxes to California, you walked backward into the street and almost got hit by a car. I saw our endgame&#x2014;to find our way back to each other when the time was right, no matter what&#x2014;disappear, and I made you promise to always take care of yourself and never die.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;ll never die,&#x201d; you said as you hugged me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was a promise you were allowed to break, it wasn&#x2019;t that one, and now I&#x2019;m forced to approach your casket in one hour to say goodbye to you.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except it&#x2019;s not going to be goodbye.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll always have you here listening. But being face-to-face with you for the first time since July and for the last time ever is going to be impossible, especially given the unwanted company of your boyfriend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#x2019;s leave his name out of my mouth as long as possible this morning, okay? If I&#x2019;m going to have any chance of getting through today, tomorrow, and all the days that follow, I think I need to go back to the start, where we were two boys bonding over jigsaw puzzles and falling in love.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s what comes after you fell out of love with me that it all goes wrong. It&#x2019;s what comes after we broke up that&#x2019;s making me so nervous. Now you can see me, wherever you are. I know you&#x2019;re there, and I know you&#x2019;re watching me, tuned in to my life to piece everything together yourself. It&#x2019;s not just the shameful things I&#x2019;ve done that are driving me crazy, Theo. It&#x2019;s because I know I&#x2019;m not done yet.<br> <b>HISTORY<br> SUNDAY, JUNE 8TH, 2014</b><br><br> I&#x2019;m making history today.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is moving faster than this L train, but it&#x2019;s all good since I&#x2019;m sitting to the left of Theo McIntyre. I&#x2019;ve known him since middle school, when he caught my eye at recess. He waved me over and said, &#x201c;Help me out, Griffin. I&#x2019;m rebuilding Pompeii.&#x201d; A puzzle of Pompeii made up of one hundred pieces, obviously. I knew nothing of Pompeii at the time; I thought Mount Vesuvius was the hidden lair of some comic book overlord. Theo&#x2019;s hands had entranced me, sorting the puzzle pieces into groups according to shades before beginning, separating the granite roads from the demolished, ash-coated structures. I helped with the sky, getting the clouds all wrong. We didn&#x2019;t get very far with the puzzle that day, but we&#x2019;ve been tight ever since.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&#x2019;s outing takes us from Manhattan to Brooklyn to see if the lost treasures in some flea market are as overpriced as everyone says they are. No matter where we are, Brooklyn or Manhattan, a schoolyard or Pompeii, I&#x2019;ve planned on changing the game up on Theo on this even-numbered day. I just hope he&#x2019;s down to keep playing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;At least we have the place to ourselves,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s almost suspicious how empty the subway car is. But I&#x2019;m not questioning it. I&#x2019;m too busy dreaming up what it would be like to always share this space and any other space with this know-it-all who loves cartography, puzzles, video animation, and finding out what makes humans tick. On a crowded train, Theo and I squeeze together when we sit, our hips and arms pressed against one another&#x2019;s, and it&#x2019;s a lot like hugging him except I don&#x2019;t have to let go as quickly. It sucks that Theo sits directly across from me now, but at least I get the very awesome view. Blue eyes that find wonder in everything (including train ads for teeth whitening), blond hair that darkens when it&#x2019;s wet, the <i>Game of Thrones</i> T-shirt I got him for his birthday back in February.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lot harder to people-watch without people,&#x201d; Theo says. His eyes lock on me. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s you, I guess.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there will be some interesting people at the flea market. Like hipsters.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hipsters are characters, not people,&#x201d; Theo says.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hipster-shame. Some of them have real feelings underneath their beanie hats and vintage flannels.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theo stands and does a bullshit pull-up on the rail; his brain gets him top marks, but his muscles can&#x2019;t carry him as high. He gives up and hops back and forth between the train benches like some underground trapeze artist. I wish he would somersault to my side and stay put. He holds on to the railing and stretches his leg to the opposite bench, and his shirt rises a little so I peek at his exposed skin peripherally while keeping my focus on Theo&#x2019;s grin. It might be my last day to do so.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train rocks to a stop and we get off, finally.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manhattan is home and all, so Theo never bad-mouths it, but I know he wishes more of its walls were stained with graffiti like they are here in Brooklyn, bright in the summer sun. Theo points out his favorites on the way to the flea market: a little boy in black and white walking across colorful block letters spelling out DREAM; an empty mirror demanding to find the fairest of them all in a crazy neat cursive that rivals Theo&#x2019;s perfect handwriting; an airplane circling Neptune, which is just fantastical enough that it doesn&#x2019;t give me flying anxiety; knights seated around Earth, like it&#x2019;s their round table. Neither of us have any idea what it&#x2019;s supposed to mean, but it&#x2019;s pretty damn cool.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s a long, hot walk to the flea market, located by the East River. Theo spots a refreshment truck, and we spend five bucks each on cups of frozen lemonade, except there isn&#x2019;t enough of the sugary slush left so we&#x2019;re forced to chew ice to survive the heat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theo stops at a table with <i>Star Wars</i> goods. His face scrunches up when he turns to me. &#x201c;Seventy dollars for that toy lightsaber?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theo&#x2019;s inside voice sucks. It&#x2019;s a problem.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forty-something vendor looks up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a recalled saber,&#x201d; she says flatly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s rare and I should be charging more.&#x201d; Her shirt reads<i> Princess Leia is not the damsel in distress you&#x2019;re looking for</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theo returns her glare with an easy smile. &#x201c;Did someone pull an Obi-Wan and cut someone&#x2019;s arm off?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My knowledge on all things <i>Star Wars</i> is pretty limited, and the same goes for Theo&#x2019;s knowledge on all things <i>Harry Potter</i>. He&#x2019;s the only sixteen-year-old human I know who isn&#x2019;t caught up on everyone&#x2019;s favorite boy wizard. One night we argued for a solid hour over who would win in a duel between Lord Voldemort and Darth Vader. I&#x2019;m surprised we&#x2019;re still friends.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The battery hatch snaps off easily and children can&#x2019;t seem to keep them out of their damn mouths,&#x201d; the woman says. She isn&#x2019;t talking to Theo anymore. She&#x2019;s talking to an equally unhappy dude her age who can&#x2019;t figure out an R2-D2 alarm clock. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Okay, then.&#x201d; Theo salutes her, and we walk away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stroll for a few minutes. (Six, to be exact.) &#x201c;Are we done here?&#x201d; I ask. It&#x2019;s hot, and I&#x2019;m melting, and we&#x2019;ve definitely seen that some of the treasures are way pricier than they legally should be.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hell no, we&#x2019;re not done,&#x201d; Theo says. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t leave emptyhanded.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So buy something.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you buy <i>me</i> something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need that lightsaber.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, stupid, buy me something else.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s safe to assume you&#x2019;re buying me something too, right?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Seems fair,&#x201d; Theo says. He taps his dangerous watch. It is actually for-real dangerous, as in it&#x2019;s not safe to wear. I&#x2019;m not even sure how or why it got made, because its sharp sundial hands have scratched unsuspecting people&#x2019;s bodies&#x2014;mine included&#x2014;enough times that he should throw it in a fireplace and kill it dead and then sue the manufacturer. He wears it anyway because it&#x2019;s different. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s meet at the entrance in twenty minutes. Ready?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Go.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Couple&#39;S Tao Te Ching: Ancient Advice for Modern Lovers</h2><p><b>Following the successful debut of the <i>Parent's Tao Te Ching</i>---William Martin now reinterprets the Tao for couples.</b><br><br>With <i>The Parent's Tao Te Ching, </i>William Martin beautifully re-interpreted Lao Tzu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i>--one of the world's oldest and most widely read books of wisdom--expressly for parents. Now, he distills and freshly re-interprets the essence of each of the Tao's 81 chapters to speak directly and clearly to couples.<br>William Martin's indelible, spirited, and sage advice, rendered in free verse, captures the ancient spirit of Lao Tzu's original text, yet speaks directly to modern lovers--and to the full sweep of their experiences and emotions. A deeply felt alternative to advice books that urge readers to manipulate their partners rather than to love them, <i>The Couple's Tao Te Ching</i> is for everyone who has embarked upon a loving relationship, which, as William Martin says, "can be the most rewarding and enlightening adventure possible."<br><i>Foreword by Hugh and Gayle Prather</i><br></p><p><b>William C. Martin,</b> a writer, teacher, and counselor, lives in Otter Rock, OR. <b><br></b>In a culture where loving associations are often treated as not much more than optional interludes, it's a singular delight to find a book successfully establishing that such relationships can, instead, fill lives with a joy and fulfillment not to be found elsewhere. And when the author goes further, as in this book, and provides immediately practical guidance on how to ensure that one's own love relationship will do just that, you have found yourself a singular book, indeed.

Beginning with the fundamentals, he goes on to run the table with lots of readable advice and detailed diagrams for how to play individual shots, including trick shots, strategies for eight- and nine-ball, and rules for the major pool games. Then it's on to billiards, where he banks from the fundamentals to the art of shot making and tactics for play at every level, touching on every conceivable cushion along the way. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Robert Byrne has won numerous tournaments including the National Senior and National Amateur tournaments in three-cushion billiards.

Many documents were destroyed during the Communist revolution (1974-1975), which vainly tried to erase 3,500 years of tradition. However, so great is the international legacy of His Majesty that many records were preserved by a grateful world, including his speeches during the period 1930 to 1974. These speeches are remarkable in that they provide a vivid panorama, through His Majesty&#39;s eyes, of the problems and challenges confronting a young Ethiopian king: national development, foreign aggression and invasion, war and resistance. ....

This puzzle, posed by Fibonacci in the 13th-century, is the premise for Gravett's latest work. The cover depicts a bemused rabbit calculating at a blackboard. The endpapers cast a wider view, with more of the problem shown visually and verbally. Readers follow a rabbit through an underground tunnel (title page) and emerge from a die-cut hole into a field &#x2013;at the top of a calendar. As always, Gravett's design choices are perfect for enhancing the narrative. Now viewers turn the book lengthwise and watch the effects of the ever-multiplying bunnies in watercolor scenes on the top, while the hand-lettered notes and novelty items glued to the dates below reveal seasonal challenges. In March, while the stressed parents learn infant care, a baby book showcases a tiny ultrasound of the twins. July depicts bored bunnies watching carrots grow. A miniature newspaper (The Fibber) includes biographical information on the famous mathematician, personals, birth announcements, graphs, and horoscopes. Under an empty, snow-covered field and through the die-cut hole that follows December 31, a peek and a page turn reveal the population explosion leaping, literally, off the page in a sturdy pop-up spread. This hilarious (and accurate) tale can be enjoyed by the numerically challenged and gifted alike.&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library. (c) Copyright 2010.

Where the world stresses the importance of success, Bird invites readers to embrace nine specific failures in the areas of our personal lives, our relationships, and the church. Why? Because what human wisdom deems indispensable is so often an impediment to our spiritual growth, and what it deems insignificant is so often essential to it.<br><br>With compelling examples from the Bible and today, Bird paints an enticing picture of the counterintuitive, countercultural life that God wants for us. He helps readers delight in all of the ways that Jesus turned the world upside-down, allowing us to experience true freedom, not from our weaknesses but in the midst of them.</p><p><b>Enter a world where failure is success, endings are beginnings, and freedom is found as we learn to submit<br></b><br>It may sound counterintuitive, but the truth is that Christianity is not just a "nicer" version of the world we live in.

Her inn defies laws of physics, her dog is secretly a monster, and the only permanent guest of the inn is a former Galactic tyrant with a price on her head. The inn needs guests to thrive and guests have been scarce, so when an Arbitrator shows up at Dina&#39;s door and asks her to host a peace summit between three warring species, she jumps on the chance. Unfortunately, for Dina, bridging the gap between space vampires, the Hope-Crushing Horde, and the merchants of Baha-char is much easier said than done.

Yet, according to Danny Dreyer and Katherine Dreyer, some 80 million Americans consider walking their most important physical activity. For this sequel to their <i>ChiRunning</i>, the authors apply the principles of balance and energy from t'ai chi to create ''ChiWalking.'' The 11 chapters follow their ''Five Mindful Steps'': ''Get Aligned,'' ''Engage Your Core,'' ''Create Balance,'' ''Make a Choice,'' and ''Move Forward.''

He takes the first subway that comes in either direction and eats dinner with the one he is delivered to. His mother complains that he never comes to see her, but he says she has a 50-50 chance. He has had dinner with her twice in the last 20 working days. Explain.</i>Marvin's adventures in probability are one of the fifty intriguing puzzles that illustrate both elementary ad advanced aspects of probability, each problem designed to challenge the mathematically inclined. From "The Flippant Juror" and "The Prisoner's Dilemma" to "The Cliffhanger" and "The Clumsy Chemist," they provide an ideal supplement for all who enjoy the stimulating fun of mathematics.Professor Frederick Mosteller, who teaches statistics at Harvard University, has chosen the problems for originality, general interest, or because they demonstrate valuable techniques. In addition, the problems are graded as to difficulty and many have considerable stature. Indeed, one has "enlivened the research lives of many excellent mathematicians." Detailed solutions are included. There is every probability you'll need at least a few of them.</p><p><p>Charles Frederick Mosteller ( 1916&#x2013;2006) was one of the eminent statisticians of the 20th century.

He was the author or co-author of more than 350 scholarly papers and more than 50 books, including one of the most popular books in his field, first published in 1965 and reprinted by Dover in 1987, <i>Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions.</i> </p><p> </p><p>Mosteller's work was wide-ranging: He used statistical analysis of written works to prove that James Madison was the author of several of the Federalist papers whose authorship was in dispute. With then&#x2013;Harvard professor and later Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, he studied what would be the most effective way of helping students from impoverished families do better in school &#x2014; their answer: to improve income levels rather than to simply spend on schools. Later, his analysis of the importance to learning of smaller class sizes buttressed the Clinton Administration's initiative to hire 100,000 teachers. And, as far back as the 1940s, Mosteller composed an early statistical analysis of baseball: After his team, the Boston Red Sox, lost the 1946 World Series, he demonstrated that luck plays an enhanced role in a short series, even for a strong team. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Though we often hear that data can speak for themselves, their voices can be soft and sly." &#x2014; Frederick Mosteller</p></p><h2>Florals By Hand: How to Draw and Design Modern Floral Projects</h2><p><b>Create your own floral and plant illustrations, with no previous artistic experience necessary!</b>&nbsp;<br><br>Each project in this beautiful book is broken into easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, making how to draw leaves and flowers (including poppies, pansies, and cherry blossoms!) as easy as 1-2-3.

Beginning with the Greeks, and through a series of philosophic, religious, and historical examples, Pieper demonstrates that "Leisure has been, and always will be, the first foundation of any culture." Of the frenetic contemporary clamor for things, entertainment, and distraction, Pieper observes, "in our bourgeois Western world total labor has vanquished leisure. Unless we regain the art of silence and insight, the ability for nonactivity, unless we substitute true leisure for our hectic amusements, we will destroy our culture&#x2014;and ourselves." For, to Pieper, slavery is a state of mind and soul into which entire peoples descend when mental, moral, spiritual, and political independence is corrupted by a preoccupation with material well-being.

Through their exploits, a group of unlikely activists exposed the shocking truth that J. Edgar Hoover was operating a shadow Bureau engaged in illegal surveillance and harassment of the American people. <br><br><i>The Burglary</i> brings the activists, who have kept their secret for forty-three years, into the public eye for the first time&#x2014;including, new to this edition, the recent discovery of the eighth and final member of the team. The burglars&#x2019; story of personal sacrifice and civil disobedience is a vital episode in the American whistle-blower tradition that includes the Pentagon Papers, Watergate&#x2019;s Deep Throat, and, most recently, Edward Snowden and the NSA.</p></p><p><p>Betty Medsger first wrote about the Media files as a reporter at <i>The Washington Post</i> in 1971. She is a founding member of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) and founder of the Center for Integration and Improvement of Journalism at San Francisco State University, where she was chair of the Department of Journalism. She is the author of <i>Women at Work, Framed: The New Right Attack of Chief Justice Rose Bird and the Courts </i>and <i>Winds of Change: Changes Confronting Journalism Education. </i>She lives in New York with her husband, John T. Racanelli.</p>In late 1970, William Davidon, a mild--mannered physics professor at Haverford College, privately asked a few people this question:<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think of burglarizing an FBI office?&#x201d;<br><br>Even in that time of passionate resistance against the war in Vietnam that included break--ins at draft boards, his question was startling. What, besides arrests and lengthy prison sentences, could result from breaking into an FBI office? The bureau and its legendary director, J. Edgar Hoover, had been revered by Americans and considered paragons of integrity for the nearly half century he had been director.<br><br>Who would dare to think they <i>could</i> break into an FBI office? Surely the offices of the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country would be as secure as Fort Knox. Just talking about the possibility seemed dangerous.<br><br>But Davidon, with great reluctance, had decided that burglarizing an FBI office might be the only way to confront what he considered an emergency: the likelihood that the government, through the FBI, was spying on Americans and suppressing their cherished constitutional right to dissent. If that was true, he thought, it was a crime against democracy&#x2014;-a crime that must be stopped.<br><br>The odds were very low that such an act of resistance could possibly succeed against the law enforcement agency headed by this man who held so much power. Nicholas Katzenbach, who as attorney general was Hoover&#x2019;s boss, had resigned in 1966 because of Hoover&#x2019;s resentment over being told by Katzenbach to manage the bureau within the law. The director&#x2019;s power was unique among all national officials, said Katzenbach. He &#x201c;ruled the FBI with a combination of discipline and fear and was capable of acting in an excessively arbitrary way. No one dared object. . . . The FBI was a principality with absolutely secure borders, in Hoover&#x2019;s view.&#x201d; At the same time, he said, &#x201c;There was no man better known or more admired by the general public than J. Edgar Hoover.&#x201d;<br><br>Such was the power and reputation of the official whose borders and files Davidon was considering invading. He knew Hoover was very powerful, but he didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;-nor could anyone outside the bureau have known&#x2014;-how harshly he ruled it and how he protected the bureau from having its illegal practices exposed. Katzenbach believed that Hoover or one of the director&#x2019;s top aides had even forged Katzenbach&#x2019;s signature in order to make it appear that the attorney general had given permission for the FBI to plant an electronic surveillance device, a bug, in civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2019;s New York hotel room. Despite what appeared to be his signature on the memorandum, Katzenbach was certain he never approved such a procedure, which he considered the &#x201c;worst possible invasion of privacy.&#x201d;<br> Hoover&#x2019;s sensitivity to criticism, Katzenbach said when he testified in December 1975 before the committee then conducting the first congressional investigation of the FBI, &#x201c;is almost impossible to overestimate. . . . It went far beyond the bounds of natural resentment. . . . The most casual statement, the most strained implication, was sufficient cause for Mr. Hoover to write a memorandum to the attorney general complaining about the criticism, explaining why it was unjustified, and impugning the integrity of its author.<br><br>&#x201c;In a very real sense,&#x201d; Katzenbach testified, &#x201c;there was no greater crime in Mr. Hoover&#x2019;s eyes than public criticism of the bureau.&#x201d;<br><br>A congressional investigation of the FBI during Mr. Hoover&#x2019;s lifetime, Katzenbach said, would have been utterly impossible. &#x201c;Mr. Hoover would have vigorously resisted. . . . He would have asserted that the investigation was unnecessary, unwise and politically motivated. At worst, he would have denounced the investigation as undermining law and order and inspired by Communist ideology. No one [in Congress] risked that confrontation during his lifetime.&#x201d;<br><br>Said Katzenbach, &#x201c;Absent strong and unequivocal proof of the greatest impropriety on the part of the director, no attorney general could have conceived that he could possibly win a fight with Mr. Hoover in the eyes of the public, the Congress or the President. Moreover, to the extent proof of any such impropriety existed, it would almost by definition have been in the Bureau&#x2019;s possession and control, unreachable except with Bureau cooperation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Five years before Katzenbach made that public assertion, Davidon was planning to do something that had never been done&#x2014;-obtain official FBI information that was otherwise unreachable. Davidon had given a lot of thought to the question before he asked it&#x2014;-&#x201c;What do you think of burglarizing an FBI office?&#x201d;<br> If anyone else had asked that question of the nine people he approached, probably each of them would have swiftly ended the conversation. Because it was Davidon, they took it seriously and kept listening despite being shocked. They trusted him. They knew he wasn&#x2019;t reckless, and they knew he believed in protest that was effective, that could lead to results. Each of them respected him so much they thought that if they ever engaged in high--risk resistance, he was one of the few people they would want as partner and leader when the stakes were high. So they listened carefully.<br><br>Some of them wrestled with the implications of his question for several days. Two said yes immediately. Only one of them, a philosophy professor, turned him down. Eight agreed with him that, repugnant as burglary was as a method of resistance, it might be the only way to find documentary evidence that would answer important questions about the FBI that no journalist or government official responsible for the FBI had dared to ask in the past or, they concluded, was likely to ask now or in the future. All of them were passionate opponents of the Vietnam War and passionate opponents of the suppression of dissent.<br> Davidon and the eight people who said yes in response to his question met as a group for the first time shortly before Christmas 1970 and chose their name, the Citizens&#x2019; Commission to Investigate the FBI. The name summed up their goal: In the absence of official oversight of this powerful law enforcement and intelligence agency, they, acting voluntarily on behalf of American citizens, would attempt to steal and make public FBI files in an effort to determine if the FBI was destroying dissent. They thought the name sounded dignified, like that of an official commission that should have been appointed years earlier by a president, an attorney general, or Congress.<br><br>Agreeing to break in only if it could be done without violating their deep commitment to nonviolent resistance, they concentrated on developing the skills necessary to conduct an unarmed burglary of the office. Beginning in January 1971, most weekday evenings, after they meticulously cased the area near the targeted FBI office for at least three hours, they drove to the Germantown neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia to the home of John and Bonnie Raines, a young couple who had agreed to participate. There, late at night in a room in the back of the Raines&#x2019; third--floor attic, they trained themselves as amateur burglars and planned the break--in. They discussed the discoveries they had made during casing and how to work around serious obstacles they had determined could not be eliminated, such as the fact that security guards stood twenty--four hours a day behind the glass front door of the Delaware County Courthouse constantly monitoring an area that included the nearby entrance to the building the burglars would enter, as well as the windows of the FBI office. Just a few days before the burglary, another critical problem developed over which they had no control: One of the burglars abandoned the group, with full knowledge of what they were going to do. He later threatened to turn them in.<br><br>On the night of March 8, 1971, the eight burglars carried out their plan. Under the cover of darkness and the crackling sounds in nearly every home and bar of continuous news about the Muhammad Ali&#x2013;-Joe Frazier world heavyweight championship boxing match taking place that evening at New York&#x2019;s Madison Square Garden and being watched on television throughout the world, the burglars broke into the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, a sleepy town southwest of Philadelphia. At first, their break--in <br> plan failed. The locks were much more difficult to pick than expected. Frustrated, the newly minted locksmith in the group found a pay phone, called the other burglars as they waited at the nearby motel room that served as the group&#x2019;s staging area, and told them the burglary might have to be called off.<br> Michael German, a former FBI agent who conducted undercover FBI operations for sixteen years before joining the staff of the American Civil Liberties Union in 2006, said he has often wondered how the Media burglars knew which files to take. &#x201c;How did they know,&#x201d; for instance, he asked, &#x201c;where the political spying files would be?&#x201d; German said he has always assumed&#x2014;-and has talked to other agents who made the same assumption&#x2014;-that because it would have been impossible for an outsider to know where particular files were, the Media burglary must have been an inside job carried out by disgruntled FBI agents familiar with the files. But the burglars had found a foolproof solution to the problem of which files to take: They removed <i>every</i> file in the office. That&#x2019;s why, as they drove away from Media in their getaway cars late that night, they had no idea what they had stolen. For all they knew, they might have just risked spending many years in prison for a trove of blank bureaucratic forms.<br><br>Within an hour of opening the suitcases they had stuffed with FBI files, they knew their risk was not in vain. They found a document that would shock even hardened Washington observers when it became public two weeks later.<br><br>The files stolen by the burglars that night in Media revealed the truth and destroyed the myths about Hoover and the institution he had built since he became its director in 1924. Contrary to the official propaganda that had been released continuously for decades by the FBI&#x2019;s Crime Records Division&#x2014;-the bureau&#x2019;s purposely misnamed public relations operation&#x2014;-Hoover had distorted the mission of one of the most powerful and most venerated institutions in the country.<br><br>The Media files revealed that there were two FBIs&#x2014;-the public FBI Americans revered as their protector from crime, arbiter of values, and defender of citizens&#x2019; liberties, and the secret FBI. This FBI, known until the Media burglary only to people inside the bureau, usurped citizens&#x2019; liberties, treated black citizens as if they were a danger to society, and used deception, disinformation, and violence as tools to harass, damage, and&#x2014;-most important&#x2014;-silence people whose political opinions the director opposed.<br> Instead of being a paragon of law and order and integrity, Hoover&#x2019;s secret FBI was a lawless and unprincipled arm of the bureau that, as Davidon had feared, suppressed the dissent of Americans. To the embarrassment and frustration of agents who privately opposed this interpretation of the bureau&#x2019;s mission, agents and informers were required to be outlaws. Blackmail and burglary were favorite tools in the secret FBI. Agents and informers were ordered to spy on&#x2014;-and create ongoing files on&#x2014;-the private lives, including the sexual activities, of the nation&#x2019;s highest officials and other powerful people.<br><br>Electoral politics were manipulated to defeat candidates the director did not like. Even mild dissent, in the eyes of the FBI, could make an American worthy of being spied on and placed in an ongoing FBI file, sometimes for decades. As the authors of <i>The Lawless State</i> wrote in 1976, the FBI &#x201c;has operated on a theory of subversion that assumes that people cannot be trusted to choose among political ideas. The FBI has assumed the duty to protect the public by placing it under surveillance.&#x201d;<br><br>Until the Media burglary, this extraordinary situation&#x2014;-a secret FBI operating under principles that were the antithesis of both democracy and good law enforcement&#x2014;-thrived near the top of the federal government for nearly half a century, affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. The few officials who were aware of some aspects of the secret FBI silently tolerated the situation for various reasons, including fear of the director&#x2019;s power to destroy the reputation of anyone who raised questions about his operations.<br><br>When these operations became known as a result of the burglary, the foundations of the FBI were shaken. The significant impact of the burglary was both long--term and immediate. As soon as the files became public, Americans&#x2019; views of the FBI started to change. Mark Felt&#x2014;-the future Deep Throat of Watergate fame, who at the time of the burglary was chief of bureau inspections and very close to Hoover&#x2014;-wrote in 1979 that the Media burglars&#x2019; disclosures &#x201c;damaged the FBI&#x2019;s image, possibly forever, in the minds of many Americans.&#x201d; Ironically, the burglary would not have been possible if Felt had not refused in the fall of 1970 a request to increase security at the Media office.<br><br>This historic act of resistance&#x2014;-perhaps <i>the</i> most powerful single act of nonviolent resistance in American history&#x2014;-ignited the first public debate on the proper role of intelligence agencies in a democratic society. Perceptions of the bureau evolved from adulation to criticism and then to a consensus that the FBI and other intelligence agencies must never again be permitted to be lawless and unaccountable. By 1975, the revelations led to the first congressional investigations of the FBI and other intelligence agencies and then to the establishment of congressional oversight of those agencies.<br><br>The writers of every history of Hoover or the bureau since the burglary have noted its significant impact. Sanford J. Ungar, author in 1976 of the first history of the bureau published after the burglary, <i>FBI: An Uncensored Look Behind the Walls</i>, wrote, &#x201c;The Media documents . . . gave an extraordinary picture of some of the Bureau&#x2019;s domestic intelligence activities. . . . Judged by any standard, the documents . . . show an almost incredible preoccupation with the activities of black organizations and leaders, both on campuses and in the cities. . . . The overall impact of the documents could not be denied or explained away. They seemed to show a government agency, once the object of almost universal respect and awe, reaching out with tentacles to get a grasp on, or lead into, virtually every part of American society.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;In one fell swoop FBI surveillance of dissidents was exposed and the Bureau&#x2019;s carefully nurtured mystique destroyed,&#x201d; wrote Max Holland about the Media burglary in his 2012 book <i>Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat</i>. &#x201c;Far from being invincible, the FBI appeared merely petty, obsessed with monitoring what seemed to be, in many cases, lawful dissent.&#x201d;<br><br>Historian Richard Gid Powers, in his 2004 book <i>Broken: The Troubled Past and Uncertain Future of the FBI,</i> described the burglary&#x2019;s impact:<br> Hoover&#x2019;s power to conduct secret operations . . . depended on the absolute freedom he had won from any inquiry into the internal operations of the Bureau. . . . Except for a remarkably few breaches of security . . . Hoover had been able to pick and choose what the public would learn about the Bureau. He had never suffered the indignity of having an outside, unsympathetic investigator look into what he had been doing, what the Bureau had become, and what it looked like from the inside. And it had been that luxury of freedom that let him indulge himself with such abuses of power as his persecution of King, the . . . COINTELPROs, and his harassment of Bureau critics.<br></p><h2>On Living Simply: The Golden Voice of John Chrysostom</h2><p>These excerpts from the sermons of Saint John Chrysostom bring fourth-century wisdom to 20th century issues.

We met three years prior, in 2003, when I created the first-ever Shakespeare program in a solitary confinement unit, and we spent three years working together in that unit. Now we have received unprecedented permission to work together, alone, unsupervised, to create a series of Shakespeare workbooks for prisoners.

The authors assign an archetypal childhood story to each image in the traditional tarot deck. Cinderella aligns with the Moon card, traditionally associated with the power of dreams and visions. Sleeping Beauty parallels the Death card with its theme of personal metamorphosis. Little Red Cap stands in for the Fool (the innocent). <br> <br>Before the Age of Reason higher learning was transmitted through archetypal characters in stories and fairy tales. In modern times these all-important stories have been relegated to a secondary position, with no recognition of their deeper meaning. The whimsical art and familiar characters of the <i>Inner Child Cards</i> will awaken dormant emotional memory that has been trapped in long-forgotten childhood stories. Tarot has always had an uncanny capacity to act as a "hall of mirrors" reflecting the true trajectory of life. By referencing fairy-tale archetypes, <i>Inner Child Cards</i> gives adults an especially clear reflection of the child within and imaginative access to the soul's own personal truth. And because of their playful nature, these cards are equally well suited for use with children.</p><p><i>Inner Child Cards</i> bring charming, fairy-tale images to the age-old tradition of the tarot. Authors and professional astrologers Isha and Mark Lerner intended to offer a fresh, innocent perspective on tarot readings while also staying grounded in recognizable archetypes. And what better way to tap into our true spirit than to recall the soul-inspiring stories of childhood? "Fairy stories, told and retold, enrich the depths of our hearts from which our hopes and ideals are born," the authors explain. "No other literary creation has such a fundamental effect upon us than has the fairy tale." Indeed, Little Red Riding Cap with her basket of goodies and her outstretched finger holding a butterfly speaks eloquently to the fragile process of individuation. The Rapunzel card with its maiden's long braid (which is eventually shorn by the evil enchantress) and the blind prince speaks to challenging times when we are cut loose from the strands of our past and must go forward in blind faith. All of the cards are lovely, with their rich images and rainbow borders. But it is the excellent accompanying text that offers readers the most enchanting journey into the past as they make meaning out of the present. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Isha Lerner has a worldwide practice as an astrologer, tarot consultant, and flower-essence practitioner. She is also the author of the <i>Power of Flowers</i> book and deck and the forthcoming <i>Inner Child Cards Workbook</i>.

In <i>Factory Girls</i>, Leslie T. Chang, a former correspondent for the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> in Beijing, tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women, whom she follows over the course of three years as they attempt to rise from the assembly lines of Dongguan, an industrial city in China&#x2019;s Pearl River Delta.<br><br>As she tracks their lives, Chang paints a never-before-seen picture of migrant life&#x2014;a world where nearly everyone is under thirty; where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a mobile phone; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Chang takes us inside a sneaker factory so large that it has its own hospital, movie theater, and fire department; to posh karaoke bars that are fronts for prostitution; to makeshift English classes where students shave their heads in monklike devotion and sit day after day in front of machines watching English words flash by; and back to a farming village for the Chinese New Year, revealing the poverty and idleness of rural life that drive young girls to leave home in the first place. Throughout this riveting portrait, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family&#x2019;s migrations, within China and to the West, providing historical and personal frames of reference for her investigation.<br><br>A book of global significance that provides new insight into China, <i>Factory Girls</i> demonstrates how<i> </i>the mass movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and transforming Chinese society, much as immigration to America&#x2019;s shores remade our own country a century ago.</p><p>Leslie T. Chang lived in China for a decade as a correspondent for the<i> Wall Street Journal. </i>She is married to Peter Hessler, who also writes about China. She lives in Colorado.1 Going Out<br><br>When you met a girl from another factory, you quickly took her measure. What year are you? you asked each other, as if speaking not of human beings but of the makes of cars. How much a month? Including room and board? How much for overtime? Then you might ask what province she was from. You never asked her name.<br><br>To have a true friend inside the factory was not easy. Girls slept twelve to a room, and in the tight confines of the dorm it was better to keep your secrets. Some girls joined the factory with borrowed ID cards and never told anyone their real names. Some spoke only to those from their home provinces, but that had risks: Gossip traveled quickly from factory to village, and when you went home every auntie and granny would know how much you made and how much you saved and whether you went out with boys.<br><br>When you did make a friend, you did everything for her. If a friend quit her job and had nowhere to stay, you shared your bunk despite the risk of a ten-yuan fine, about $1.25, if you got caught. If she worked far away, you would get up early on a rare day off and ride hours on the bus, and at the other end your friend would take leave from work--this time, the fine one hundred yuan--to spend the day with you. You might stay at a factory you didn't like, or quit one you did, because a friend asked you to. Friends wrote letters every week, although the girls who had been out longer considered that childish. They sent messages by mobile phone instead.<br><br>Friends fell out often because life was changing so fast. The easiest thing in the world was to lose touch with someone.<br><br>The best day of the month was payday. But in a way it was the worst day, too. After you had worked hard for so long, it was infuriating to see how much money had been docked for silly things: being a few minutes late one morning, or taking a half day off for feeling sick, or having to pay extra when the winter uniforms switched to summer ones. On payday, everyone crowded the post office to wire money to their families. Girls who had just come out from home were crazy about sending money back, but the ones who had been out longer laughed at them. Some girls set up savings accounts for themselves, especially if they already had boyfriends. Everyone knew which girls were the best savers and how many thousands they had saved. Everyone knew the worst savers, too, with their lip gloss and silver mobile phones and heart-shaped lockets and their many pairs of high-heeled shoes.<br><br>The girls talked constantly of leaving. Workers were required to stay six months, and even then permission to quit was not always granted. The factory held the first two months of every worker's pay; leaving without approval meant losing that money and starting all over somewhere else. That was a fact of factory life you couldn't know from the outside: Getting into a factory was easy. The hard part was getting out.<br><br>The only way to find a better job was to quit the one you had. Interviews took time away from work, and a new hire was expected to start right away. Leaving a job was also the best guarantee of getting a new one: The pressing need for a place to eat and sleep was incentive to find work fast. Girls often quit a factory in groups, finding courage in numbers and pledging to join a new factory together, although that usually turned out to be impossible. The easiest thing in the world was to lose touch with someone.<br><br>* * *<br><br>For a long time Lu Qingmin was alone. Her older sister worked at a factory in Shenzhen, a booming industrial city an hour away by bus. Her friends from home were scattered at factories up and down China's coast, but Min, as her friends called her, was not in touch with them. It was a matter of pride: Because she didn't like the place she was working, she didn't tell anyone where she was. She simply dropped out of sight.<br><br>Her factory's name was Carrin Electronics. The Hong Kong-owned company made alarm clocks, calculators, and electronic calendars that displayed the time of day in cities around the world. The factory had looked respectable when Min came for an interview in March 2003: tile buildings, a cement yard, a metal accordion gate that folded shut. It wasn't until she was hired that she was allowed inside. Workers slept twelve to a room in bunks crowded near the toilets; the rooms were dirty and they smelled bad. The food in the canteen was bad, too: A meal consisted of rice, one meat or vegetable dish, and soup, and the soup was watery.<br><br>A day on the assembly line stretched from eight in the morning until midnight--thirteen hours on the job plus two breaks for meals--and workers labored every day for weeks on end. Sometimes on a Saturday afternoon they had no overtime, which was their only break. The workers made four hundred yuan a month--the equivalent of fifty dollars--and close to double that with overtime, but the pay was often late. The factory employed a thousand people, mostly women, either teenagers just out from home or married women already past thirty. You could judge the quality of the workplace by who was missing: young women in their twenties, the elite of the factory world. When Min imagined sitting on the assembly line every day for the next ten years, she was filled with dread. She was sixteen years old.<br><br>From the moment she entered the factory she wanted to leave, but she pledged to stick it out six months. It would be good to toughen herself up, and her options were limited for now. The legal working age was eighteen, though sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds could work certain jobs for shorter hours. Generally only an employer that freely broke the labor law--"the very blackest factories," Min called them--would hire someone as young as she was.<br><br>Her first week on the job, Min turned seventeen. She took a half day off and walked the streets alone, buying some sweets and eating them by herself. She had no idea what people did for fun. Before she had come to the city, she had only a vague notion of what a factory was; dimly, she imagined it as a lively social gathering. "I thought it would be fun to work on the assembly line," she said later. "I thought it would be a lot of people working together, busy, talking, and having fun. I thought it would be very free. But it was not that way at all."<br><br>Talking on the job was forbidden and carried a five-yuan fine. Bathroom breaks were limited to ten minutes and required a sign-up list. Min worked in quality control, checking the electronic gadgets as they moved past on the assembly line to make sure buttons worked and plastic pieces joined and batteries hooked up as they should. She was not a model worker. She chattered constantly and sang with the other women on the line. Sitting still made her feel trapped, like a bird in a cage, so she frequently ran to the bathroom just to look out the window at the green mountains that reminded her of home. Dongguan was a factory city set in the lush subtropics, and sometimes it seemed that Min was the only one who noticed. Because of her, the factory passed a rule that limited workers to one bathroom break every four hours; the penalty for violators was five yuan.<br><br>After six months Min went to her boss, a man in his twenties, and said she wanted to leave. He refused.<br><br>"Your performance on the assembly line is not good," said Min's boss. "Are you blind?"<br><br>"Even if I were blind," Min countered, "I would not work under such an ungrateful person as you."<br><br>She walked off the line the next day in protest, an act that brought a hundred-yuan fine. The following day, she went to her boss and asked again to leave. His response surprised her: Stay through the lunar new year holiday, which was six months away, and she could quit with the two months' back pay that the factory owed her. Min's boss was gambling that she would stay. Workers flood factory towns like Dongguan after the new year, and competition for jobs then is the toughest.<br><br>After the fight, Min's boss became nicer to her. He urged her several times to consider staying; there was even talk of a promotion to factory-floor clerk, though it would not bring an increase in pay. Min resisted. "Your factory is not worth wasting my whole youth here," she told her boss. She signed up for a computer class at a nearby commercial school. When there wasn't an overtime shift, she skipped dinner and took a few hours of lessons in how to type on a keyboard or fill out forms by computer. Most of the factory girls believed they were so poorly educated that taking a class wouldn't help, but Min was different. "Learning is better than not learning," she reasoned.<br><br>She phoned home and said she was thinking of quitting her job. Her parents, who farmed a small plot of land and had three younger children still in school, advised against it. "You always want to jump from this place to that place," her father said. Girls should not be so flighty. Stay in one place and save some money, he told her.<br><br>Min suspected this was not the best advice. "Don't worry about me," she told her father. "I can take care of myself."<br><br>She had two true friends in the factory now, Liang Rong and Huang Jiao'e, who were both a year older than Min. They washed Min's clothes for her on the nights she went to class. Laundry was a constant chore because the workers had only a few changes of clothes. In the humid dark nights after the workday ended, long lines of girls filed back and forth from the dormitory bathrooms carrying buckets of water.<br><br>Once you had friends, life in the factory could be fun. On rare evenings off, the three girls would skip dinner and go roller-skating, then return to watch a late movie at the factory. As autumn turned into winter, the cold in the unheated dorms kept the girls awake at night. Min dragged her friends into the yard to play badminton until they were warm enough to fall asleep.<br><br>The 2004 lunar new year fell in late January. Workers got only four days off, not enough time to go home and come out again. Min holed up in her dorm and phoned home four times in two days. After the holiday she went to her boss again, and this time he let her leave. Liang Rong and Huang Jiao'e cried when Min told them her news. In a city of strangers, they were the only ones who knew about her departure. They begged her to stay; they believed that conditions at other factories were no better, and that to leave or to stay would be the same in the end. Min did not think so.<br><br>She promised she would return for a visit after she got paid at her new job. Min left that same day with a few clothes in a backpack and the two months' wages that the factory owed her. She did not take her towels and bedding with her; those things had cost money, but she couldn't bear the sight of them anymore.<br><br>In ten months on the assembly line, Min had sent home three thousand yuan--about $360--and made two true friends.<br><br>She should have been scared. But all she knew was that she was free.<br><br>* * *<br><br> In the village where Lu Qingmin was born, almost everyone shared her family name. Ninety households lived there, planting rice, rape, and cotton on small plots of land. Min's family farmed half an acre and ate most of what they grew.<br><br>Her future appeared set when she was still a child, and it centered on a tenet of rural life: A family must have a son. Min's parents had four girls before finally giving birth to a boy; in those early years of the government policy limiting families to one child, enforcement was lax in much of the countryside. But five children would bring heavy financial burdens as the economy opened up in the 1980s and the cost of living rose. As the second-oldest child, Min would bear many of those burdens.<br><br>She disliked school and did poorly. As long as she could remember, she was in trouble. She climbed the neighbors' trees to steal their plums; if she was caught she got a beating. Once when her mother ordered her to do chores, Min refused. "There are so many people at home. Why do I have to do it?" Her mother chased her for a quarter mile and hit her with a stick.<br><br>She was good at having fun. She learned how to swim and to drive a truck; she loved roller-skating and hid her injuries from her mother. "I have fallen every way there is to fall," Min said. "But you can't think about that." She was her father's favorite. One summer, he rented a truck and she traveled the countryside with him, selling watermelons from their farm. They drove during the day and slept in the truck at night; it became one of Min's fondest memories. Most migrants associated the place they came from with poverty and backwardness, and some were even reluctant to say the name of their village. But long after Min came to the city, she still talked about her hometown as if it were something beautiful.<br><br>In the late 1990s, both of Min's parents went out to work to earn money for their children's schooling. Her father worked in a shoe factory on the coast, but poor health drove him back. Later her mother went out for a year. Min boarded at a middle school in a nearby town but returned home every weekend to cook and wash clothes for her father and the younger children.<br><br>Almost all the young people in her village had gone out. When Min was still in middle school, her older sister, Guimin, went to work in a factory in Dongguan. Soon after, Min failed the national high school entrance exam and her parents considered having her go out, too. Guimin phoned home and urged them to keep Min in school; Guimin's factory wages, she said, would help cover the tuition. Their parents agreed, and Min enrolled in a two-year vocational high school. That made her one of the most educated people in the village--more educated than Guimin, who had sacrificed her own schooling to help the family.<br><br>Guimin came home for the 2003 lunar new year holiday and took Min away with her when she left. Min had one more semester of school, but she wanted to save the tuition and get a jump on the job hunt. She was thrilled to be leaving home; she had never ridden on a train or seen a factory. "I wanted to get out early, learn some things, and see the world," she said.<br><br>In Dongguan, Guimin rented a cheap hotel room for Min and found her a job in a Japanese factory that made liquid crystal displays. Min worked there for a month and left. She had never been in a place where she didn't know anyone, and she was so lonely she couldn't bear it. She returned to the hotel and found a job at another factory but didn't take it. Her sister offered to continue paying for the hotel room, but Min felt herself becoming a burden. At a bus station, she spotted a help-wanted flyer for a quality-control job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. She dialed the number on the ad--many were just scams to trick migrants out of their money--and the person who answered the phone gave Min directions to the factory. It was a three-hour bus ride to the southeast tip of Dongguan and Carrin Electronics, the place where Min spent her hard year alone.<br>The minute she entered the factory grounds, Min realized the place was worse than the Japanese factory she had just left behind. But it was too late to turn back, and she did not want to ask her sister's help again. She was getting used to being on her own--it was better that way.</p><h2>Paris Match: A Stone Barrington Novel</h2><p><b>Stone Barrington finds himself in a dark place in the City of Light in this international thriller in Stuart Woods&#x2019;s #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.<br><br></b>When some business arrangements demand his personal attention, Stone Barrington jaunts off to Europe and immediately finds himself embroiled in trouble on both sides of the pond.

Fred was quick.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have the car around in five minutes, Mr. Barrington,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Fred.&#x201d;</p><p>Fred hustled the three cases onto the elevator and disappeared. Stone turned to Ann Keaton, who was sitting on the end of his bed, fully dressed and ready to go to her job at the New York City campaign headquarters of Katharine Lee, the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. Ann was her deputy campaign manager.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you crying because I&#x2019;m leaving?&#x201d; Stone asked. &#x201c;I mean, you&#x2019;ve known for weeks that I have to go to Paris for the opening of the new hotel, l&#x2019;Arrington.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s not why.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in two or three weeks, and you&#x2019;re going to be so busy with the campaign that you won&#x2019;t even notice that I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll notice,&#x201d; Ann said. &#x201c;I have something to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a minute,&#x201d; Stone said. He buzzed his secretary, Joan Robertson. &#x201c;Ask Fred to pick up the Bacchettis, then come back for me,&#x201d; he said. Then he returned and sat next to Ann on the bed.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m crying because I won&#x2019;t be here when you get back,&#x201d; Ann said.</p><p>This was news to Stone. &#x201c;And where will you be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In Washington.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand, Kate said you could work out of New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kate changed her mind,&#x201d; Ann said. &#x201c;She wants me to work with Sam more closely. She wants us to meet every day, and Sam can&#x2019;t come to New York.&#x201d; Sam Meriwether, the senior senator from Georgia, was Kate Lee&#x2019;s campaign manager.</p><p>&#x201c;And this is until the election?&#x201d; Stone asked hopefully.</p><p>&#x201c;Only if Kate isn&#x2019;t elected,&#x201d; Ann said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve talked about what happens if she gets elected: I&#x2019;ll be heading up the search operation for administration appointees, while remaining her chief of staff. And after the inauguration&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, you&#x2019;ll be the second-most-powerful person in the world?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what everybody says,&#x201d; Ann said, then she renewed her crying.</p><p>&#x201c;Ann, I can understand that if you have to choose between being with me and being the second-most-powerful person in the world, why you might not choose me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I hate that about myself!&#x201d; she sobbed. &#x201c;Why do I want that above personal happiness?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;d be doing it for your country,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;and, of course, because you&#x2019;d be the second-most-powerful person in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you hate me?&#x201d; Ann asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. I love you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not <i>in </i>love with me, not anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a self-defense mechanism,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I know I can&#x2019;t have you, so I can&#x2019;t be in love.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can understand that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s got to protect himself. Still, I wish <i>you</i> were the one crying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hardly ever cry,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;You should try it sometime, it&#x2019;s good for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to take your word for it.&#x201d; He got up, took her hand, and pulled her to her feet. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s go down. I have to pick up my briefcase from Joan.&#x201d;</p><p>They took the elevator down to his office, where his briefcase stood open on his desk, with Joan standing guard.</p><p>&#x201c;I got you ten thousand euros,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If you need more, you can just use your ATM card. The bank says it works in Europe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep that in mind,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t see how I can spend ten thousand euros in two or three weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find a way,&#x201d; Joan said, with a confidence born of keeping him in cash.</p><p>&#x201c;Is the car out front?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, everything&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, I&#x2019;ll drop you at your office,&#x201d; he said to Ann.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to walk, get some fresh air and get over feeling sorry for myself, and that will take a few minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>She walked him out to the car, where Fred already had the rear door open. He kissed Ann goodbye, got in, and kissed Viv Bacchetti on the cheek. Fred closed the door and got behind the wheel.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Dino?&#x201d; he asked. Her husband, the newly minted commissioner of police for New York, was coming to Paris with them, where he was attending a conference of high-ranking police officials from Europe and the United States. They were taking the Gulfstream 650 jet belonging to Strategic Services, Viv&#x2019;s employer and the world&#x2019;s second-largest security company. She was to oversee the security staff at the new hotel, until things were running smoothly.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming in his car,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;or rather his motorcade. He had to pick up the L.A. chief of police and the Boston commissioner. The only way the mayor would let Dino ride in a corporate jet was if the other two guys came along, too, and Mike Freeman was okay with that. It&#x2019;s a motorcade, because those guys are each traveling with two of their own detectives.&#x201d; Freeman was the CEO of Strategic Services.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s go, Fred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look funny,&#x201d; Viv said.</p><p>&#x201c;Funny queer or funny ha-ha?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Funny queer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just had to say goodbye to Ann.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she&#x2019;ll be here when you get back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, she&#x2019;ll be in Washington, very likely for years to come. Kate wants her there to work more closely with Sam Meriwether.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, so do I, but I don&#x2019;t like it much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s not such a bad thing, Stone, maybe it&#x2019;s time for you to be a free man again.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone didn&#x2019;t know how to reply to that.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>AT TETERBORO they were let through the security gate at Jet Aviation and Fred drove them to the big airplane. There was a line of black SUVs already there, disgorging men in suits and their luggage. Mike Freeman was greeting them at the airplane&#x2019;s door and turning them over to the two stewardesses, who would settle them in. Someone got their luggage out of the trunk, then Stone followed Viv up the stairs and to their seats. Dino made the introductions, then the three of them occupied seats together, along with Mike Freeman. The moment everyone was buckled into a seat, the airplane was taxiing. With no delay, they were on the runway, then down the runway and climbing.</p><p>&#x201c;Paris awaits,&#x201d; Mike said.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you looking forward to it?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I always do. By the way, Stone, you won&#x2019;t be driving into the city with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I had a call from Lance Cabot this morning.&#x201d; Cabot was the director of Central Intelligence. &#x201c;His people will be transporting you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very weird,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought so, too,&#x201d; Mike replied.</p><p>And then they were eating a big breakfast.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Stone stepped out the door of the Gulfstream 650 and, from the top of the stairs, viewed what seemed a whole lot of badly parked SUVs. They were there to transport the occupants of the G-650 and their detectives, bodyguards, and the police officers who had come to greet them. One vehicle stood out: a white Mercedes van that was bigger and taller than the usual van. Leaning against it, grinning, was one Richard LaRose, known as Rick, who was the newly appointed Paris station chief of the Central Intelligence Agency. As Stone walked toward the man he caught sight of a Gulfstream 450 being towed into a nearby hangar, and he saw something familiar painted on an engine nacelle, a symbol he had seen before.</p><p>&#x201c;Stone!&#x201d; Rick yelled.</p><p>Stone turned and waved, then pointed out his luggage to a lineman, then pointed at the big van, then he strolled over and shook hands with the grinning Rick, forgetting the Gulfstream. &#x201c;Rick, how are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better than fine,&#x201d; Rick replied, &#x201c;and I rate better transportation these days.&#x201d; He jerked a thumb toward the van. Rick&#x2019;s former transport had been a battered gray Ford van that he had done terrible things to.</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations on the new job,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Lance mentioned it.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s luggage was stored in a rear compartment, then Rick slid open the door of the van to reveal an interior that was more jetliner than van: four seats, two abreast, facing across a burled walnut tabletop. The cabin was swathed in soft beige leather. On one of the seats sat Lance Cabot, director of Central Intelligence, offering Stone a small, cool smile.</p><p>Stone got in and shook hands. &#x201c;What a surprise to see you in Paris, Lance,&#x201d; he said. He always was wary around Lance, today no less so.</p><p>&#x201c;In my line of work I try to surprise,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;When people expect you, bad things can happen.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick slid in beside Lance and closed the door, then rapped sharply on the bulkhead behind him. The van moved smoothly away</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you across the pond?&#x201d; Stone asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>Lance gazed out the window at the passing scenery. &#x201c;Oh, I thought I&#x2019;d come over and help Rick get settled into his new office. And into his new job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that is very much appreciated, Lance,&#x201d; Rick said, somehow avoiding sounding obsequious.</p><p>&#x201c;Also, I wanted the opportunity to speak with you privately before you reach your new hotel,&#x201d; Lance said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, here I am, and this looks private to me. Assuming we can trust Rick, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;Stone, your arrival in Paris coincides with two notable gatherings in the city: one is the meeting of that group of important policemen, now called the Congress of Security, or in the way of the world these days, CONSEC. Although many of these gentlemen have met at one time or another, this is the first time all of them have met at once. The importance of that meeting is indicated by the place of their conference, the �lys�e Palace, which, as you know, is the seat of the president of France.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone nodded; he knew that much, at least.</p><p>&#x201c;The other gathering, which will not be publicized, is of a criminal nature, though it will appear to be a conference of business executives. This is an organization of Russian oligarchs, most of them former KGB generals and colonels, who have grown rich and fat in their new, so-called democracy. What was formerly a loose network of old chums, colleagues, and enemies has now gelled into a more formal entity, which they call the Cowl, as in the hood of a monk. The apparent head monk is Yevgeny Majorov, the son of a very, very important KGB general, now thankfully deceased, and the brother of another decedent, Yuri Majorov, in whose death they suspect you of having had a hand.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone raised a finger. &#x201c;I deny that,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Deny it all you like,&#x201d; Lance replied. &#x201c;The fact is that Yuri wanted you dead because you would not accept him as a partner in your hotel business, and he had brought with him to Los Angeles a feared mafia assassin, who sometimes worked freelance, for the express purpose of ensuring your demise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe I heard something about that,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yuri, as we now know, departed Los Angeles in his private jet, bound for Moscow, and arrived in that city, having apparently expired of natural causes en route.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;These things happen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yuri&#x2019;s death coincided with that of his hired assassin, in his bed at the Bel-Air Hotel, and his killer used a little something from the gentleman&#x2019;s own pharmaceutical supply to off both the assassin and Yuri.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a certain poetry to that,&#x201d; Stone observed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and that standard of &#x2018;poetry&#x2019; is rarely found outside organizations such as the one I head. In fact, I believe this particular &#x2018;poet&#x2019; to be a former member of my flock, one Teddy Fay, but I can&#x2019;t prove it, and that fact alone causes me to suspect Teddy. That and the fact that Teddy&#x2019;s name, photographs, fingerprints, and DNA test have recently vanished from every intelligence and law enforcement database in the United States and its possessions, along with the databases of all those nations with whom we share such data.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will have to take the Fifth on that one,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;There is only one way this could have happened,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;Not even I could have engineered it, and I can engineer almost anything, if I try hard enough. No, that action originated far, far above my pay grade. One, and only one, personage could have initiated it, and he, coincidentally, is a friend of yours. But, for reasons of both decorum and self-preservation, I will say no more about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Lance, that is a relief.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, but you have little else about which to be relieved, Stone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is that supposed to mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It means that Yevgeny Majorov has made some of the same deductions I have made, and he believes you, in one way or another, to be responsible for both his brother&#x2019;s failure to penetrate the ownership of your hotel group and for his brother&#x2019;s untimely demise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The man must be delusional,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless,&#x201d; Lance said, &#x201c;while you are in Paris you are going to have to watch your ass&#x2014;or rather, Rick and his coterie are going to have to. Do you understand and accept this fact?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sighed. &#x201c;If I must,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you must. Good day to you.&#x201d; The van glided to a stop at a Paris street corner; Lance exited the vehicle and immediately got into a black sedan.</p><p>&#x201c;Now to l&#x2019;Arrington,&#x201d; Rick said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>Rick&#x2019;s van took so many turns down so many narrow streets that Stone lost his bearings. After a time, however, the van slowed for a left turn, and Stone saw, for the first time, the gates to the new hotel. They turned and drove through a handsome archway into a large courtyard. A building that was probably impressive under ordinary circumstances had been concealed by acres of scaffolding and plastic cloth.</p><p>&#x201c;I believe they&#x2019;re sandblasting the limestone facade,&#x201d; Rick said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope the inside looks better,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;What was this place before it was a hotel?&#x201d; Rick asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a hotel,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;Before that it was a hospital that Marcel duBois&#x2019;s father had bought and turned into a cheap hotel. Marcel has now turned it into an expensive one.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone alit from the big van and discovered that it had been followed by three black SUVs, which now disgorged Dino and Viv Bacchetti, Mike Freeman, and the top policemen of Los Angeles and Boston and their luggage.</p><p>Dino came over and peeked into Rick&#x2019;s van. &#x201c;I want one of these,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Stone introduced everybody to Rick, while a team of bellmen erupted from the hotel to collect all their luggage.</p><p>&#x201c;Is this place finished?&#x201d; Dino asked, looking around.</p><p>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;The paint in your room may still be wet, though.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no check-in process; they were immediately escorted into elevators, and Stone was shown into a large, elegantly furnished suite, while Dino and Viv were put in an adjoining bedroom.</p><p>A large crystal vase of calla lilies stood on a table in Stone&#x2019;s living room, and he read the attached card. <i>Welcome to your new home in Paris</i>, it said, and was signed by Marcel duBois.</p><p>Dino and Viv unpacked and returned to the sitting room, where tea and some light food had been brought up.</p><p>&#x201c;When do we see Marcel duBois?&#x201d; Viv asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see him at dinner. Dino, when do your meetings start?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The day after tomorrow. We&#x2019;re supposed to get over the jet lag during that time. What was the deal with the white van?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It contained Lance Cabot,&#x201d; Stone explained, &#x201c;who wanted to tell me...</p></p><h2>The Music in George&#39;s Head: George Gershwin Creates Rhapsody in Blue</h2><p><p><b>A picture book biography of famous composer George Gershwin and a look at his famous composition <i>Rhapsody In Blue</i>.</b></p><p>George Gershwin heard music all the time&#x2014;at home, at school, even on New York City's busy streets.

But their differing views on how to run the newly created United States turned them into the worst of friends. They each became leaders of opposing political parties, and their rivalry followed them to the White House. Full of both history and humor, this is the story of two of America&#39;s most well-known presidents and how they learned to put their political differences aside for the sake of friendship.</p><p>Besides being an award-winning author, Suzanne Tripp Jurmain was a child and teen actor appearing in many television shows and soap operas. She is currently a freelance writer and editor and lives in Los Angeles, California.<br><br>Larry Day (www.day-here.com) is an award-winning illustrator. He also works as a storyboardist at a large advertising agency. He lives in Chicago, Illinois.Gr 2-4-Suzanne Tripp Jurmain makes early American history more accessible and our founding fathers more human for young students in her book (Dutton, 2011) about the friendship and feud between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She profiles both the differences between these two men as well as the bond that grew between them as they worked together to forge a new nation. Problems arose over the question of balance of power: Adams believed that the president should be given more power, while Jefferson feared that a president who was too powerful might damage the new government. Their dispute was exacerbated when Adams was elected president, with Jefferson as his vice president, and their opposing political parties escalated the feud to the point of violence. When Jefferson defeated Adams for the presidency in the next election, it seemed that their friendship would be doomed. The book ends on a positive note, however, as the two did reconnect through a long string of correspondences, and they died on the same day. Richard Poe expressively reads this engaging, heartwarming tale with clarity and humor. By humanizing these two friends, rivals, and leaders, students will be better able to understand this segment of American history and the intricacies of our early government.-MaryAnn Karre, Horace Mann and Thomas Jefferson Elementary Schools, Binghamton, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

In this unprecedented photographic journey, editor Karl Kolbitz opens the door to 144 of the city&#x2019;s most sumptuous entrance halls, captivating in their diversity and splendor. These vibrant Milanese entryways, until now hidden away behind often restrained fa�ades, are revealed as dazzling examples of Italian modernism, mediating public and private space with vivid configurations of color and form, from floors of juxtaposed stones to murals of minimalist geometry.</p><p>The collection spans buildings from 1920 to 1970 and showcases the work of some of the city&#x2019;s most illustrious architects and designers, including Giovanni Muzio, Gio Ponti, Piero Portaluppi, and Luigi Caccia Dominioni, as well as non-pedigreed architecture of equal impact and interest. The photographs for the publication were exclusively created by Delfino Sisto Legnani, Paola Pansini, and Matthew Billings, each evoking the entryways with individual sensibility and a stylistic interplay of detail shots&#x2015;such as stones, door handles, and handrails&#x2015;with larger architectural views.</p><p>The images are accompanied by outstanding written contributions from Penny Sparke, Fabrizio Ballabio, Lisa Hockemeyer, Daniel Sherer, Brian Kish, and Grazia Signori, together bringing a wealth of architecture, design, and natural stone expertise to guide the reader through the applied materials and fittings as well as the art-historical and social implications of each of the ingressi. As much an architectural city guide as an aesthetic study, the book provides the exact address and an annotated Milan map for all featured entryways, as well as the architect name and date of construction.</p><p>In the well-documented realm of 20th-century Italian design, Kolbitz has stepped over the threshold and delivered a brand new area of inquiry in Milanese modernism. With the rigor of its multifaceted research, poised photography, and breadth of its featured hallways, this is an invigorating new reference work and an inside look at the city&#x2019;s design DNA across high to low architecture.</p></p><p>Fabrizio Ballabio is an architect and writer.

Forty years ago a small cadre of dedicated researchers began actively investigating cases, interviewing witnesses, and exchanging data through a small, informal network of international contacts. Today this low-profile network, or "invisible college," has grown into a larger, multi-nation volunteer research effort joined by many individuals. But the questions first raised 40 years ago remain current-and unanswered. <p> "I believe that a powerful force has influenced the human race in the past and is again influencing it now. Does this force represent alien intervention, or does it originate entirely within human consciousness? This is the question that forms the basis of the work of the Invisible College of UFO researchers." -- Jacques Vallee </p><p> "THE INVISIBLE COLLEGE is unlike any other UFO book ever written. Dr. Vallee questions what everybody else takes for granted, doubts what everybody believes, drenches us with data that doesn't 'fit' any of the theories of either the True Believers or the die-hard non-believers and then offers a hypothesis on his own." -- Robert Anton Wilson </p><p> "An important book-not only are UFOs and psychic events inextricably linked, as Dr. Vallee so nicely points out, but neither can be understood without an appreciation of the role of myth, tradition, and belief system. Must reading for the serious student of contemporary events." -- Edgar Mitchell </p><p> "Certainly one of the most interesting, thought-provoking books so far written on UFOs." -- Colin Wilson </p><p> Dr. Jacques Vallee began his professional life as an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in 1961. While on the staff of the French Space Committee, he witnessed the destruction of the tracking tapes of unknown objects orbiting the earth, initiating a lifelong interest in the UFO phenomenon. Vallee arrived in the U.S. in 1962 and worked in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin before receiving a Ph.D. in computer science from Northwestern University in 1967. There he became a close associate of J. Allen Hynek, then scientific consultant for the U.S. Air Force on Project Blue Book-the result was The Invisible College.

Stage sampled world-class barbecue in Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, and Memphis, soaking up "the Southern barbecue vibe" (and picking up Creole, Asian, and Cuban influences along the way) before setting up shop in Syracuse, New York, in 1988. <i>Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse</i> captures the reach-out-and-taste-it smell of slow-cooked barbecue that hits you two blocks away from the "genuine honky-tonk rib joint," where outfront a row of gleaming Harleys stand at attention and inside a sassy, ready-to-bust-your-chops wait staff cuts through the eclectic crowd of bikers, students, suits, and blues lovers (there's live music almost nightly), serving up half-racks of Dinosaur-Style Ribs, Texas Beef Brisket, and Honey Hush Corn Bread.<p> Between recipes for Drunken Spicy Shameless Shrimp with Brazen Cocktail Sauce and Not Your Mama's Meatloaf are samples of the restaurant's infamous restroom graffiti ("When life gives you lemons... add vodka") and photos of staff tattoos. Stage and coauthor Nancy Radke realize that not all backyard grill masters own smokers, let alone the kind of hickory-log-fueled industrial pits at the Dinosaur (nicknamed "The Coffin" and "The Doghouse"), so they present home cooks with a helpful Techniques of Outdoor Cookin' section that offers advice on how to grill and smoke with wood chips. </p><p> And no matter the season, this cookbook will quickly become a dog-eared favorite, as many of the more than 100 recipes are perfect for indoor cooking anytime of the year. Whip up a batch of the all-purpose Mutha Sauce (a versatile starting off point for many of the dishes) and you'll have enough ammunition for a weekend's worth of recipes.

His works, which comprise over twenty volumes, include such classics as The Path to Salvation and A Commentary on Psalm 118, as well as many volumes of letters. Although he lived the last twenty-eight years of his life as a hermit, his impact on his homeland was immense. His articles appeared in the popular spiritual journals of his time, his books were in great demand, and he personally replied to an average of thirty letters daily.<p>In the present book, Thoughts for Each Day of the Year, St. Theophan takes us through the yearly cycle of Gospel and Epistle readings, humbly and reverently offering us brief but powerful daily meditations on the word of God. He also addresses the problems of his day lack of faith, coldness of heart, trust in the rational mind rather than in the revealed Truth of God which are problems of our day as well. </p><p>Contemplating the sacred texts together with St. Theophan, the reader will learn to penetrate more deeply into Holy Scripture, and will receive answers to many dogmatic, moral, and spiritual questions which touch upon our salvation. Thoughts for Each Day of the Year can help us to more closely connect our lives with the life of Christ in His Holy Church, and to gain a better knowledge of how to fulfill His commandments. By reading St. Theophan's daily exhortations and taking them to heart, one can be changed by the grace-filled power of our Savior, in accordance with the teaching of the Apostle Paul: Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God (Rom. 12:2).</p></p><p></p><h2>The Skin, Tongue and Nails Speak: Observational Signs of Nutritional Deficiencies</h2><p>People complain all the time about faults in their physical appearance.

The Discourse draws upon the previous tradition-especially Origen, St Methodius of Olympus and above all, St Athanasius&#39; On the Incarnation (PPS 44) and influences later fathers like St John of Damascus in his On the Orthodox Faith (PPS 62). This complex work is also known for its ambiguous relationship to Origen&#39;s universalism, perhaps including the idea that the devil himself will be saved. The translator&#39;s introduction places this question, and a clear understanding of the Catechetical Discourse in general. In the context of St Gregory&#39;s use of rhetoric, his other writings and the broader patristic tradition.</p><p>Ignatius green is a priest of the Orthodox Church.

He knew to undress, and to fold his clothes neatly behind the door, so that I walked into an immaculate room, nothing between me and the softly folded fist of his body but anticipation. While desire rose off Steve in fumes, steeping the whole room in its cloying vapor, I reveled in its absence. Just minutes before entering the Red Room, I adjusted my garters before the dressing room mirror, wrapped my fingers in electrical tape, and felt that happy absence, whose vacancy made room for some other, unnamed thing to fill me. I felt it already, the way you can smell autumn coming. Steve was into heavy flogging, and the tape protected the clefts between my index and middle fingers where I would soon clench a flogger handle in each hand.</p><p>I had cued the music&#x2014;which piped from the main office into all twelve rooms of the dungeon&#x2014;to begin just a few seconds before I walked into the Red Room. The music I sessioned to was all the same; while I preferred angrier music for meaner sessions, all that really mattered was the bass line. I didn&#x2019;t need a plan to have a good session; I needed a pulse.</p><p>If that great red-walled room was a womb, I was its heart. I was the moving center, my will a muscular force. There was nowhere I could go, it seemed, that the cushion of my client&#x2019;s longing wouldn&#x2019;t support me. It happened to be 10:45 in the morning, but the only time that mattered in that room was indicated on the wall-mounted timer that I turned a full circle when I walked in. There was only ever one hour in the dungeon.</p><p>As I closed the door behind me, the pale stripe of my body shifting on the mirrored walls, I dropped my supply box on the floor by the door. Steve flinched at the sound, as I&#x2019;d intended. I let my heels fall heavy against the wood floor on my way to a row of hooks lining the wall. Retrieving a smooth length of rope, I draped it around my shoulders. Then, finding Steve&#x2019;s favorite floggers, I held one in each hand, letting their thick tassels swing against my legs as I approached him, knowing the gentle slap of leather against my legs would agitate him. Standing over his curled body from behind, I dropped a flogger to the floor on either side of him and bent over so that only the tips of my hair, and my breath, touched him.</p><p>"Get the fuck up," I whispered.</p><p>"Yes, Mistress," he exhaled, and hurried to his feet, head still bowed toward his chest. Steve also knew that looking at me was a privilege he had to earn. Pulling his hands behind his back, I slid the rope off my shoulders and looped it around his wrists. With a few quick loops and a single knot, I securely bound his arms from wrists to shoulders. I paused then, giving him a few moments to absorb the warmth of my body so close behind him, and the embrace of the rope, which I knew would only feel tighter as our hour progressed. There were clients I cowed with words, but with Steve his own anticipation was enough to wilt him into submission; I just had to pause and let it accumulate. Slowly dragging the tip of my finger from the base of his spine to the hard vertebral knuckle at the base of his neck, I watched a shudder follow my touch up his body. Pausing again, I let my fingertip rest on him, and knew how the heat of my touch rippled out across his body. No job, indeed, no exercise I&#x2019;ve ever done, has been so coldly empathic as this one. I grabbed a handful of hair from the back of Steve&#x2019;s head and pulled hard. Steve yelped, and sank jerkily to his knees. I stepped around in front of him, keeping my handful of hair so that when I crouched down to face him, his head was thrust back to face the ceiling, eyes wide and wild. His mouth trembled with short breaths, lips parted. Pressing a finger against his chin, I gave his hair an extra tug to open his mouth wider.</p><p>"Thirsty, Steve?" I asked. He knew I alluded to the golden shower I would end the session with, if he was good. Steve was always good. Between now and then, however, I would tan his ass with those leather tails until he cried for mercy.</p><p>Who pays to get peed on before their breakfast has been digested? It&#x2019;s a logical question, and one I&#x2019;ve answered after nearly every explanation of my working hours. The day shift began at 10:30 A.M. on weekdays and ended at 5:30 P.M. Often I would arrive at the dungeon at 10:20 and already have a client waiting for me. It didn&#x2019;t take long to figure out that most of the patrons of the dungeon were not, as I had originally suspected, social outcasts who spent their time in basement apartments fondling pet snakes and watching pornography. They were seemingly normal. The majority of them were married fathers, and they were nearly all professionally successful. My client base consisted of stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, rabbis, grandpas, bus drivers, restauranteurs, and retirees. Getting peed on, spanked, sodomized, or diapered was less often a delicacy than a basic provision to these men. And while the need for it was compulsive, it was also routine; it was an itch that they had been compulsively scratching for many years, and it did not require an atmosphere of nighttime, intoxication, or great fanfare. The day-shift crowd scheduled their whippings the way they scheduled business luncheons: out of necessity and convenience. En route to the dungeon they dropped off the dry cleaning, or their wives at Macy&#x2019;s. Just as the caf�s all over midtown Manhattan had their lunch rushes, so did we.</p><p>After Steve&#x2019;s thirst had been quenched and he&#x2019;d showered and dressed, we exchanged the usual pleasantries: I asked after his wife, and he tipped me a crisp fifty-dollar bill. Leaning my head out the door of the Red Room, I called, "Walking out!"&#x2014;our practice of warning the occupants of nearby rooms to stay put. Clients could never meet in the halls of the dungeon. Then I led Steve down the opulent passageway to the magnetically locked chamber leading to the elevator.</p><p>"I&#x2019;ll see you on Friday," I said.</p><p>"Thank you, Justine." Steve smiled warmly and adjusted his tie. Before I had even heard the click of the door&#x2019;s lock, I pulled my hair into a bun, kicked off my heels, and headed back to clean the Red Room. I had an exam the next morning to study for.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Whip Smart by Melissa Febos.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Melissa Febos.<br>Published in 2010 by Thomas Dunne Books.<br>All rights reserved.

Featuring nearly 100 authentic dishes plus lavish photography accompanying every recipe, this stunning cookbook is the definitive guide to Thailand&#x2019;s culinary street culture. The recipes, such as Steamed Fish with Chilli and Lime Sauce, Pork Satay, Roast Duck and Egg Noodle Soup, and Sweet Banana Roti illuminate the beguiling world of food so integral to the Thais. <br>&nbsp;<br>Scholar and chef David Thompson lives with a singular passion for Thailand&#x2019;s customs, culture, and people. Although he claims &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about the food,&#x201d; this ambitious work shares his insights into the rhythms and nuances of Thai daily life along with a fascinating history of its richly diverse street cuisine. This cookbook is a tempting, inspiring, and authoritative account of Thai street food, the vibrant culinary mosaic rich with community.</p><p><strong> Fall into Cooking Featured Recipe from David Thompson's <em>Thai Street Food</em>: Fried Chicken and Squid Rice Noodles </strong> <p>When I first ate these krua gai noodles I wasn&#x2019;t convinced. I had so many other noodle dishes that enticed and pleased, some of which are also in <em>Thai Street Food</em>. Now I am addicted to the winning simplicity of them. <br></p> <p>In Bangkok&#x2019;s Chinatown there are many versions, some with prawns, others use pork but mostly squid and chicken is the order of the day.</p> <p>As you walk down the narrow alleys of this quarter, away from the busy main streets, it&#x2019;s like stepping back in time. It&#x2019;s still bustling, though, with the air filled with spices, chatter and the scraping clatter of smoking woks.</p> <p>To make the best of this recipe you&#x2019;ll need to season your wok. It imparts a smoky, slightly metallic tang to the dish: a lingering sign of success is the breath of the wok. All you need to do is prime the wok by burning it, scorching it over a flame and turning it to ensure that every part is charred. Wash out the wok then return it to the heat and it's ready. --<em>David Thompson</em><br></p> <p><strong>Serves 2</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p>3 oz chicken breast fillet, with or without skin as preferred<br> a drizzle of light soy sauce, plus 2 tablespoons extra<br> 1 garlic clove, peeled<br> pinch of salt<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 3 oz cured squid (plaa meuk chae) or fresh squid or cuttlefish, scored and finely sliced<br> ground white pepper<br> 1&#x2013;2 teaspoons preserved Chinese vegetable (dtang chai), rinsed and drained<br> 2 heaped tablespoons chopped spring (green) onions<br> 2 heaped tablespoons chopped Asian celery (optional)<br> 8 oz fresh wide rice noodles<br> 1&#x2013;2 teaspoons dark soy sauce, to taste<br> good pinch of white sugar<br> 2 eggs, ideally duck eggs<br> 1 cup loosely packed, very coarsely cut Chinese lettuce<br> pinch of deep-fried garlic<br> 1&#x2013;2 tablespoons chopped coriander<br> sauce Siracha, to serve<br></p> <p>Slice the chicken and briefly marinate it in a drizzle of light soy sauce. Crush the garlic to a somewhat coarse paste with the salt&#x2014;either by pounding it using a pestle and mortar or finely chopping it with a knife.</p> <p>Heat the wok then add 2 generous tablespoons of the oil. Add the chicken and the cured squid and lightly stir-fry until golden and almost cooked. Stir in the garlic paste, a pinch of white pepper, the preserved Chinese vegetable and 1 tablespoon each of the spring onions and Asian celery (if using). By now most of the oil should have been absorbed; drain off any excess.</p> <p>Pull apart the rice noodle strands and add to the wok, spreading them over the contents of the wok and onto the surface of the wok itself. Leave undisturbed for a moment--up to 30 seconds--then gently begin to stir and shuffle the noodles and the wok. It is important not to break the noodle strands while doing this. Drizzle the noodles with the extra 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce, the dark soy sauce and the sugar. Sprinkle them with most of the remaining Asian celery and spring onions, along with a good pinch of white pepper. Turn up the heat slightly to caramelize the noodles, stirring occasionally and carefully. After a minute or two, push the noodles to one side of the wok and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Turn up the heat, crack in the eggs and fry until they are just beginning to set and the edges of the whites are beginning to brown. Lightly break up the eggs, then gently stir and fold in the noodles, simmering them for a few minutes so that they caramelize and char slightly. Finish with the Chinese lettuce and the remaining Asian celery.</p> <p>Serve the noodles sprinkled with the deep-fried garlic, the remaining spring onions, the coriander and a pinch of white pepper.</p> <p>Accompany with a bowl of sauce Siracha.</p> <br>DAVID THOMPSON is an award-winning chef, restaurateur, and author, and the world&#x2019;s most distinguished scholar of Thai cuisine.

In her previous life she was CEO of her own marketing firm, authored several screenplays, and produced a reality TV show.1<br><br> <i>Tall sailing ships, </i>their masts and sails outlined with glowing white lights, ghosted across Charleston Harbor in a glittering parade. Canvas snapped, wooden hulls creaked and rocked, and an enormous crowd of onlookers, completely galvanized by this amazing spectacle, let loose shrieks of joy.<br><br> "This is fantastic," Theodosia Browning said as she lifted a hand to her face to block out a sliver of ambient light. "I've never seen anything like it."<br><br> "Magnificent," Drayton Conneley declared. "There hasn't been this much razzle-dazzle since the Union shelled Fort Sumter back in 1861."<br><br> It was the night of the Gaslights and Galleons Parade. Two dozen tall ships had sailed here from all points of the globe&#x2014;Britain, France, South America, even Singapore&#x2014;to dazzle the thousands of people who had gathered in White Point Garden on the shell-strewn banks of Charleston's famed Battery. Of course, Theodosia and Drayton, as invited guests of Timothy Neville, were thrilled with their perch high up on the third floor widow's walk that graced their friend's Archdale Street mansion.<br><br> "Wouldn't you love to be sailing on one of those ships right now?" Theodosia asked Drayton in a dreamy voice. Running the Indigo Tea Shop was her number one passion, but sailing wasn't far behind. She was in heaven when she was out on the water, the wind snapping her riot of auburn hair into long streamers and the salt air making her blue eyes sparkle and lending her fair complexion a soft glow as if lit by a saint's candle.<br><br> But Drayton looked absolutely horrified as he answered. "Me? On a sailing ship? Absolutely not. Don't you know by now that I'm a confirmed landlubber?"<br><br> "What if you were magically transported to a clipper ship?" Theodosia favored him with a wry grin. "One of the early ships tasked with transporting bales of wonderful black tea from China to England?"<br><br> "Say, now," Drayton said, taking a step back from the railing. "That's not quite playing fair. You're appealing to my weakness for tea and history."<br><br> Drayton was sixty-something, the portrait of a proper Southern gentleman with his tweeds, bow ties, grayed hair, and regal bearing. He was also the best tea sommelier Theodosia had ever encountered. Drayton was so well schooled in the art of tea and tea blending that she considered herself fortunate to have wooed him away from his teaching post at Johnson &amp; Wales culinary school to work side-by-side with her at the Indigo Tea Shop. They'd been together for a half dozen years now, always refining their tea menu, upgrading the d�cor of the charming Church Street tea shop, and catering countless tea parties.<br><br> Tonight was one of those parties. Well, sort of.<br><br> A recent spate of warm spring weather had caused native plum trees to explode in a riot of purple glory all over the Historic District. In a nod to this auspicious occasion, Theodosia had brought along a wicker hamper heaped with plum and black currant scones. Drayton's contribution was a special plum-flavored Ceylonese black tea that he'd custom blended. These offerings were in addition to the elegant light supper buffet that Timothy had laid out in the downstairs dining room for his two dozen guests.<br><br> "Getting chilly," Theodosia said, pulling her pink cashmere wrap tight around her shoulders. She was outdoorsy and loved to jog, sail, and hike. Delighted in breezing around the low country with the hardtop off her Jeep, but tonight had turned downright cold.<br><br> "But nobody's leaving," Drayton pointed out. They were standing at one end of the widow's walk, a long, narrow wooden walkway that ran the length of the home's roofline. All along the walkway, people were spread out, conversing quietly in small groups, eagerly watching the ships as they bobbed and wheeled in the harbor. It was difficult to see who these other guests were up here, since the night sky was so black and moonless and Theodosia and Drayton had arrived a little late to the party. Too late to be properly introduced. In any case, all the folks up top had to concentrate on watching their step, since the decorative wrought-iron railing that bordered the widow's walk was barely three feet high.<br><br> "Perhaps we should go in," Drayton suggested. "Warm up and enjoy some light supper along with Timothy's hospitality." He glanced at his watch, an antique Piaget, and frowned. "It's gotten so dark I can't quite make out the time."<br><br> Theodosia glanced sideways at St. Sebastian's, the nearest neighborhood church in a city so filled with churches it had been dubbed the Holy City. A lighted clock in a red brick steeple shone the current time. "It's just nine o'clock," she said.<br><br> "Still, tomorrow is a workday," Drayton said. "You know how I like to get a jump on Mondays."<br><br> "I hear you," Theodosia said. "Plus, we've got . . ."<br><br> BOOM!<br><br> A thunderous roar pierced the night, frightening onlookers and rattling windows in homes up and down the block.<br><br> Theodosia clapped a hand to her chest. "What was that?"<br><br> "Cannon volleys," Drayton said. "From two of the ships in the harbor, I'd guess."<br><br> Theodosia peered through the still mostly bare treetops. "Let's hope they don't do it&#x2014;"<br><br> BA-BOOM!<br><br> "&#x2014;again," she finished<br><br> But this time the cannons' roar was followed by a high-pitched scream.<br><br> "Help!" came a woman's cry from the far end of the widow's walk. "He's been shot!"<br><br> "What?" Drayton said, startled.<br><br> A second scream rose up, a terrified yelp that quickly morphed into an anguished and frantic shriek, like steel wheels grinding against hot metal rails.<br><br> Then came a terrifically loud thumping, like the sound a flat tire makes when it whap whap whaps against pavement. Except this was no flat tire. This was . . .<br><br> "Someone's fallen!" a man's voice bellowed. This was followed by a dozen voices rising in a collective, jangled outcry.<br><br> Theodosia spun quickly and peered down over the edge of the roof. Off to her right, twirling head over teakettle, a man was hurtling down the sloped slate roof of Timothy's house as if he were zipping down a child's slide.<br><br> "Help!" the falling man cried as he flailed and fought for handholds. His pleading, anguished note pierced the darkness. Pierced Theodosia's heart as well.<br><br> "Dear Lord!" Theodosia cried. She hoped the poor man would find something, anything, to break his fall.<br><br> "This is dreadful," Drayton said with a sharp intake of breath.<br><br> They watched helplessly as the man flopped and tumbled, then landed in a deep V that formed one of the eaves in the expansive roof. His arms flew out, beating wildly, as his fingers scrabbled desperately to find something to grasp. But he was moving too fast to completely arrest his fall and immediately catapulted down another few feet, heading for a decorative balcony. The man floundered again, making a grab for a balustrade to halt his terrible descent. His fingers grazed it by a mere inch. Then his body torqued grotesquely as he banged his forehead against the top of a stone window pediment and a thin mist sprayed out in slow motion. Blood.<br><br> Theodosia was in shock. It was as if the poor man had been caught in a hellish pinball machine, helplessly spinning and bouncing his way downward.<br><br> Theodosia felt Drayton's hand grab her shoulder in a death grip as they watched the man take a final, sharp tumble and then disappear into darkness.<br><br> "Was he really shot?" Drayton asked, his voice hoarse and shaking. "By the cannon? Or did he fall?"<br><br> But Theodosia had already bolted past Drayton and was dashing for the doorway.<br><br> "Does anybody have a phone?" she cried out. "Someone call an ambulance right now! Please!"<br><br> And then Theodosia was running, practically stumbling, down a flight of steps, the thick Oriental carpet whisper soft under her fast-moving feet. She hit the second floor landing, spun past a man and woman who stared at her with quizzical expressions, and then rushed down a wider stairway to hit the first floor landing. From there she was pounding down a long hallway past a parade of Timothy Neville's Huguenot ancestors, all memorialized in gleaming oil portraits and staring down at her with faintly disapproving looks.<br><br> Out the front door she ran, across the broad piazza, down the front steps, and around the side of the house into Timothy's garden. It was an elaborate Asian garden replete with reflecting pool, thickets of bamboo, statuary, and pattering fountains.<br><br> Maybe the poor man hadn't been fatally wounded at all, Theodosia reasoned. Maybe he'd simply lost his footing, tumbled down, and somehow landed in Timothy's reflecting pool. That was her one hopeful thought. That he was spitting water right now, shaking his head, moaning over a broken arm or smashed collarbone. He'd need an ambulance, of course. And a wild-lights-and-siren trip to the emergency room. But perhaps there was still hope. There was always hope . . . wasn't there?<br><br> But when Theodosia reached the backyard, she slid to a stop and gasped in shock. The poor man had landed directly on top of the antique wrought-iron fence that encircled Timothy's property. Reeling from such a frightful sight, Theodosia put a hand to her mouth and stifled a groan. Like a carefully collected insect held in place by a pin, the man was grotesquely impaled upon the sharply pointed fleur-de-lis spikes that topped the old fence.<br><br> Tiptoeing closer, drawn almost hypnotically to this gruesome tableau, Theodosia stared at the hapless man. His eyes were open wide in surprise and his white shirt was splattered with blood. Worst of all, one of the razor-sharp points of the fence had been driven clean through his neck.</p><h2>The Art of the Pitch: Persuasion and Presentation Skills that Win Business</h2><p>Through an engaging and humorous narrative, Peter Coughter presents the tools he designed to help advertising and marketing professionals develop persuasive presentations that deliver business.

This entertaining introduction reflects the enduring popularity of archaeology--a subject which appeals as a pastime, career, and academic discipline, encompasses the whole globe, and spans some 2.5 million years. From deserts to jungles, from deep caves to mountain tops, from pebble tools to satellite photographs, from excavation to abstract theory, archaeology interacts with nearly every other discipline in its attempts to reconstruct the past. In this new edition, Bahn brings his text completely up to date, including information about recent discoveries and interpretations in the field, and highlighting the impact of developments such as the potential use of DNA and stable isotopes in teeth, as well the effect technology and science are having on archaeological exploration, from nuclear imaging to GPS. Bahn also shows how archaeologists have contributed to some of the most prominent debates of our age, such as the role of climate change, the effects of rises in sea-level, and the possibility of global warming. This edition also includes updated suggestions for further reading.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Bahn</strong> is a freelance writer, translator, and broadcaster in archaeology.

No one reading this volume can fail to appreciate the debt we owe to the 'Genevan Reformer' Lawson has consulted the best of current scholarship and has produced a comprehensive distillation of the contours of the Reformer's preaching and, with it, a compelling advocacy of consecutive expository preaching. A magnificent achievement. </p> --Derek W.H. Thomas, Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia S.C. Robert Strong Professor of Systematic and Pastoral Theology Reformed Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Ga.<br><br><p>In this book, Dr. Steve Lawson has masterfully presented us with thirty-two keynotes that made Calvin the best preacher of the Reformation, all of them centered around the Word of God preached expositorily. He describes for us in a powerful as well as profound way how Calvin brought his congregation upward to gaze upon God's glory as he preached verse by verse, then ended his sermons with prayer filled with the Word! Dr. Lawson is right in saying that because of the spiritual bankruptcy of our time, we need Calvins once again. I would make this book recommended reading in courses such as homiletics and missions for any serious pastor and student of theology. </p> --Dr. Alonzo Ramirez, Professor, Biblical Reformed Seminary, Peru</p><h2>Baby Sleep Book (Sears Parenting Library)</h2><p><b>Everything you need to know about getting your baby or toddler to sleep -- from America's foremost baby and childcare experts.</b><br><b><br></b>Babies don't automatically know how to sleep through the night; they need to be taught.

Seeing blossoms swirling through the air&#x2014;Beeke renders them as a flurry of white smudges&#x2014;Fletcher becomes convinced that the snow has returned. Feeling bouncy [and] full-of-importance, he sounds the alarm to his forest comrades, who are not a little peeved when they realize Fletcher's mistake. All is quickly forgiven as they revel in the glories of the season: The animals scooped up pawfuls and clawfuls of blossoms from the ground, and covered him in a tickly shower of fluttering white petals! The distinctly British lilt of Rawlinson's prose should prove captivating for preschoolers. But it's Beeke who gives this book its reason for being. Working in her signature na�f style, she gives each character a vivid personality (the steadfast porcupine and slacker rabbits are particularly memorable) and conjures up an irresistible forest: bathed in warm greens and yellows, punctuated with impish bursts of color, and just imposing enough to be a suitable setting for adventure.

Every day Mrs. P. asks Hannah if she would like to pet Sugar, and every day, Hannah says, "No, thank you." Hannah is afraid of dogs, so despite Sugar living up to her name and being a sweet, gentle pup, Hannah remains apprehensive. One day, Sugar goes missing and everyone begins looking for her. Sadly, she is nowhere to be found until one night Hannah hears a noise, crawls between the bushes, and finds Sugar with her leash caught in the tangled branches. Nervously, Hannah finds the courage to reach out and pet Sugar and eventually frees the dog. Sugar is reunited with her owners, and Hannah has a new friend.

While this is one of the reasons that the instrument produces such colorful and interesting timbres, it also contributes to the difficulties of sight reading. It is important to develop facility in reading, recognizing the notes, as well as the bar positions in which to play them, the fingerings, the rhythmic patterns, and any markings if interpretation (dynamics, phrasing, articulation, etc.). <br>This book provides an orderly and systematic approach to the study of sight reading, based upon standards for sight reading for the classical guitar found in respected schools around the world.</p><p></p><h2>Neurofeedback in the Treatment of Developmental Trauma: Calming the Fear-Driven Brain</h2><p><p><strong>Working with the circuitry of the brain to restore emotional health and well-being.</strong></p> Neurofeedback, a type of "brain training" that allows us to see and change the patterns of our brain, has existed for over 40 years with applications as wide-ranging as the treatment of epilepsy, migraines, and chronic pain to performance enhancement in sports. <p>Today, leading brain researchers and clinicians, interested in what the brain can tell us about mental health and well being, are also taking notice. Indeed, the brain's circuitry&#x2015;its very frequencies and rhythmic oscillations&#x2015;reveals much about its role in our emotional stability and resilience. Neurofeedback allows clinicians to guide their, clients as they learn to transform brain-wave patterns, providing a new window into how we view and treat mental illness.</p><p>In this cutting-edge book, experienced clinician Sebern Fisher keenly demonstrates neurofeedback&#x2019;s profound ability to help treat one of the most intractable mental health concerns of our time: severe childhood abuse, neglect, or abandonment, otherwise known as developmental trauma.</p><p>When an attachment rupture occurs between a child and her or his primary caregiver, a tangle of complicated symptoms can set in: severe emotional dysregulation, chronic dissociation, self-destructive behaviors, social isolation, rage, and fear. Until now, few reliable therapies existed to combat developmental trauma. But as the author so eloquently presents in this book, by focusing on a client's brain-wave patterns and "training" them to operate at different frequencies, the rhythms of the brain, body, and mind are normalized, attention stabilizes, fear subsides, and, with persistent, dedicated training, regulation sets in.</p><p>A mix of fundamental theory and nuts-and-bolts practice, the book delivers a carefully articulated and accessible look at the mind and brain in developmental trauma, what a &#x201c;trauma identity&#x201d; looks like, and how neurofeedback can be used to retrain the brain, thereby fostering a healthier, more stable state of mind. Essential clinical skills are also fully covered, including how to introduce the idea of neurofeedback to clients, how to combine it with traditional psychotherapy, and how to perform assessments.</p><p>In his foreword to the book, internationally recognized trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk, MD, praises Fisher as &#x201c;an immensely experienced neurofeedback practitioner [and] the right person to teach us how to integrate it into clinical practice.&#x201d; Filled with illuminating client stories, powerful clinical insights, and plenty of clinical "how to," she accomplishes just that, offering readers a compelling look at exactly how this innovative model can be used to engage the brain to find peace and to heal.</p> 8 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Sebern F.

I can say, as a trauma therapist, who uses neurofeedback as one of many treatment modalities, Sebern Fishers&#x2019; methods are tried and true. I use these methods and find them extremely effective.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Psychology Today, Dr. Diane Brain Health</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The writing is excellent. [Sebern Fisher] helps explain why and how developmental trauma devastates and also why and how it is different than single-incident trauma or traditional post-traumatic stress. . . . She has taken on the mountain &#x2013; the human brain &#x2013; and helped us scale it and understand the dragon of fear that resides within for those of us with developmental trauma. . . .

Sebern Fisher combines a mastery of neurofeedback with a real knack for applying neuroscience to do nothing less than lay the groundwork for a new, powerful, mind-brain approach to the most serious cases of developmentally-based psychological trauma. Even if you don&#x2019;t practice neurofeedback, the treasure of precious clinical insights it offers so deepen an appreciation of the brain-mind interaction, that you can&#x2019;t help but be changed by this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Norman Doidge, MD, author of <em>The Brain that Changes Itself</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book illustrates the masterful use of neurofeedback in psychotherapy for developmental trauma disorders. A must-read for all clinicians involved in the treatment of trauma spectrum disorders!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ruth Lanius, MD, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Research Unit, University of Western Ontario</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is the year, or perhaps the century, of the brain. What more can we ask than to have someone tell us how to change the brain in ways that improve our lives. In this book Sebern Fisher does just that. Over the many years of our many discussions about what works and what doesn&#x2019;t work in treating mental health problems, she has made a convincing argument that neurofeedback as a direct approach to changing behavioral patterns of the brain is an approach worth putting your money on. A truly wonderful, clinically insightful book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marsha M.

After many years of telling stories I have found that each story takes on a life of its own and that the audiences help shapethe story. &#34;Grandmother Spider Brings The Sun&#34; has certainly found it&#39;s rightful place in the hearts of hundreds of children and I hope it will find a place in yours.Northland Publishing continues its popular line of traditional Native American tales, now under a new imprint, Rising Moon, with this Cherokee creation story. In this tale, light is brought to the dark side of the world, where all the animals are always bumping into each other and getting lost. Sneaky Coyote convinces the others that they should steal a piece of the sun so carefully guarded on the other side of the world, and shy Possum and cocky Buzzard make attempts with hilarious results. It is the most unlikely individual-tiny, wise old Grandmother Spider-who has the best idea, and she is still honored for this today.

Straight forward, to the point, demystifying the secrets in recording. If material beats method, THIS is the way to go!&#34; Axe Follin &#34;I just wanted to say thanks for your work. Straight to the point, and it doesn&#39;t drag on. Perfect. I&#39;ve learned lots from it.&#34; Jared Gardner It&#39;s the best of its kind! &#34; Florian Huckler In my opinion, the BEST book for recording TECHNIQUES. There are interviews with professional engineers littered throughout the text, explaining what they use, how they use it, where they put mics. Obviously there are no rules when recording, but this will help you see some of the basic setups for recording literally ANYTHING! Dr. Kenneth &#34;I just got through reading this and it is excellent.&#34; John Newton A crucial manual for anyone who records anything, anywhere, with any gear. Small wonder I see this profusely written text in most, if not all the studios I record in! It really is a &#34;field manual&#34; for recording engineers; many consider it a classic. Paul ILL This is an excellent source of information not just for the beginner but for anyone who is looking for a few tips and tricks to make their work better. While some of the information is basic, sometimes a little review is useful to correct problems that have crept into an engineer&#39;s habits. Through the interviews Owsinski conducted, you can clearly see that there are several different approaches to capturing music. What works best, it fast becomes clear, is more a function of the engineer than anything else. It also makes it clear that your ear is the most important tool you have at your disposal and it should be used throughout the session. For me, the references on mic positions for various instruments are useful but I find the greatest value in the interviews. For anyone looking to up their game, you could do far worse than to add this to your bookshelf. Wayne Bouchard Young students often ask me for suggestions on how to get started as a recording engineer. I always point them to Bobby O&#39;s excellent series on recording and mixing. &#34;The Recording Engineer&#39;s Handbook&#34; isn&#39;t just one author&#39;s &#34;how to&#34; book - Bobby has interviewed a vast array of pro recording engineers on every audio recording engineering subject and area. As an experienced working engineer himself, Bobby knows the questions to ask his subjects to bring out the thinking process behind the recording of music. What the reader gains is a start at building their own intuition on how to tackle recording engineering situations and problems. &#34;The Recording Engineer&#39;s Handbook&#34; is a great cross-pollination of recording techniques and ideas and is a valuable resource to both the student and working recording engineer. Highly recommended. Michael J. Bishop Excellent book with loads of resourceful information. Both new and seasoned engineers could gather knowledge from this book. Nick Tuttle Best book for recording hands down- If you are serious about getting a professional sound this is the book for you. p.s. Bobby is a genius, any book with his name on it is worth reading! Noah Hans This is an excellent quick reference guide for anyone new to recording or the seasoned veteran that just needs a reminder on a specific technique. It&#39;s one of the few technical guides that you can read without having to have the equipment in front of you. Johnny Sokko This book is the most informative book about recording I ever read. It&#39;s starts with the different types of mics and what the specs mean. Then it goes on to talk about mic placement for different instruments. A list of every conceivable instrument you can think of and how to record them. I&#39;ve learned so much from this book. i should have bought this years ago.

They have three children.Petzinger, a reporter and editor for the Wall Street Journal, presents a thorough analysis of the growth of the airline industry from the 1930s to the present. He demonstrates in a highly detailed manner the competitive nature of the airline business in such notable battles as those between Robert Crandall (American) and Dick Ferris (United) and between Frank Lorenzo (Texas International) and Herb Kelleher (Southwest). Fueled by the big egos of their respective bosses, the major airlines fell into a financial abyss trying to serve the maximum number of passengers and destinations, only to face rising fuel, labor, and operating costs as well as rising debt?while Southwest Airlines became a model of success and profitability. Petzinger exposes the men behind airline growth and competition, computerization, deregulation, strikes, mergers, and bankruptcies and covers current alliances such as the one between KLM and Northwest.

It has been rhapsodized by hip-hop artists and coveted by cops and crooks alike. Created in 1982 by Gaston Glock, the pistol arrived in America at a fortuitous time.&nbsp;Law enforcement agencies had concluded that their agents and officers, armed with standard six-round revolvers, were getting "outgunned" by drug dealers with semi-automatic pistols; they needed a new gun. With its lightweight plastic frame and large-capacity spring-action magazine, the Glock was the gun of the future. You could drop it underwater, toss it from a helicopter, or leave it out in the snow, and it would still fire. It was reliable, accurate, lightweight, and cheaper to produce than Smith and Wesson&#x2019;s revolver. <br>&nbsp;<br>Filled with corporate intrigue, political maneuvering, Hollywood glitz, bloody shoot-outs&#x2014;and an attempt on Gaston Glock&#x2019;s life by a former lieutenant&#x2014;<i>Glock </i>is not only the inside account of how Glock the company went about marketing its pistol to police agencies and later the public, but also a compelling chronicle of the evolution of gun culture in America.</p></p><p><p><b>PAUL M.

The pair had been robbing banks and armored trucks in southern Dade County over the past four months. To catch them, Gordon McNeill, a supervisory special agent with the Miami field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had set up a rolling stakeout. &#x201c;They had killed two people; another woman was missing,&#x201d; McNeill said. &#x201c;They had shot another guy four times. In my twenty-�one years with the agency, I never felt more sure that when we found these guys, they would go down hard.&#x201d;<br><br>Moments later, other FBI units converged; soon, three unmarked sedans trailed the bank robbers. McNeill, closing from the opposite direction, spotted the black Monte Carlo at the head of the strange convoy. In the passenger seat, one suspect shoved a twenty-�round magazine into a Ruger Mini-�14 semiautomatic rifle. &#x201c;Felony car stop!&#x201d; McNeill shouted into his radio to the other units. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it!&#x201d;<br><br>FBI vehicles corralled the Monte Carlo, ramming the fugitive automobile and forcing it into a large driveway. The three remaining government sedans skidded into surrounding positions. Two more FBI cars arrived across the street. In all, eight agents faced the two suspects.<br><br>Suddenly, one of the fugitives started shooting. FBI men scrambled for cover and returned fire. The occupants of the Monte Carlo seemed to be hit in the fusillade, but the government rounds weren&#x2019;t stopping them.<br><br>In the chaos, the federal agents struggled to reload their revolvers, jamming cartridges one after another into five-� and six-�shot Smith &amp; Wessons. Three of the FBI agents were members of a special-�tactics squad and carried fifteen-�round S&amp;W pistols. But none of the handgun fire seemed to slow the criminals. The gunman with the Ruger Mini-�14 merely had to snap a new magazine into his rifle to have another twenty rounds instantly. One of his mags had forty rounds. His partner had a twelve-�gauge shotgun with extended eight-�round capacity. The bank robbers were armed for a small war.<br><br>Agent McNeill took a round in his right hand, shattering bone. Shredded flesh jammed the cylinder of his revolver, making it impossible to reload. He rose from a crouch to reach for a shotgun on the backseat of an FBI vehicle. As he did, a .223 rifle round pierced his neck. He fell, paralyzed. A fellow agent was severely wounded when he paused to reload his Smith &amp; Wesson Chief&#x2019;s Special. &#x201c;Everybody went down fighting,&#x201d; McNeill said. &#x201c;We just ran into two kamikazes.&#x201d;<br><br>As law enforcement officials would later discover, the bank robbers, Michael Platt and William Matix, were no ordinary thugs. They had met in the 1970s at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Matix served as a military policeman with the 101st Airborne. Platt received Special Forces training. Both were practiced marksmen. They operated a landscaping business and according to neighbors seemed like hardworking individuals. Neither one had a criminal record. But something had turned them into psychopaths.<br><br>Platt, demonstrating his deadly close-�combat skills, worked the shoulder-�fired Mini-�14 with precision. Based on the M14 military rifle, the Mini-�14 was popular with small-�game hunters, target shooters, and, ironically, the police. Platt took full advantage of the semiautomatic weapon&#x2019;s large magazine and penetrating ammunition. Bobbing and weaving, he sneaked up on Grogan and Dove, the agents who had originally spotted the black Monte Carlo. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming behind you!&#x201d; another agent screamed. But the warning came too late. Platt fatally shot Grogan in the torso and Dove in the head.<br><br>The firefight had been going on for four minutes when Agent Edmundo Mireles, badly wounded, staggered toward Platt and Matix, who had piled into a bullet-�ridden FBI Buick. A civilian witness described Mireles&#x2019;s stiff-�legged gait as &#x201c;stone walking.&#x201d; Holding a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 Magnum at arm&#x2019;s length, he fired repeatedly at the two gunmen at point-�blank range, killing them both. It was the bloodiest day in FBI history.<br><br>All told, the combatants fired 140 rounds. In addition to the deaths of Platt and Matix, two FBI agents were killed, three were permanently crippled, and two others were injured. gun battle &#x201c;looked like ok corral,&#x201d; the Palm Beach Post declared the next morning, quoting a shaken witness. But the legendary gunfight in 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona, had lasted only thirty seconds and involved just thirty shots, leaving three dead&#x2014;�one fewer than the modern-�day battle in Miami.<br><br>///<br><br>Lieutenant John H. Rutherford, the firing-�range director with the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, heard about the shootout later that day. &#x201c;The bad guys,&#x201d; he recalled, &#x201c;were starting to carry high-�capacity weapons, unlike what they had carried in the past. . . . That was a scary, terrible thing to hear about,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If the FBI is outgunned, something is wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>Scholars of law enforcement and small arms pored over the forensic records of the Miami Shootout, generating thousands of pages of reports. Police departments across the country held seminars on the gun battle. Gun magazines published dramatic reconstructions. NBC broadcast a made-�for-�TV movie called In the Line of Fire: The FBI Murders.<br><br>Later examination would reveal that, for all their bravery, the FBI agents prepared poorly for the violent encounter. At the time, though, and ever since, one idea about the significance of Miami eclipsed all others. The lawmen had been, in Lieutenant Rutherford&#x2019;s word, &#x201c;outgunned.&#x201d; It was a perception widely shared by cops, politicians, and law-�abiding firearm owners: The criminals were better armed than the forces of order. Nationwide, crime rates were rising. Drug gangs ruled inner-�city neighborhoods. Guns had replaced knives in the hands of violent teenagers. The police, the FBI, and all who protected the peace were increasingly seen as being at a lethal disadvantage. The FBI helped shape this perception by emphasizing the seven revolvers its agents had used, deflecting attention from the three fifteen-�round pistols and two twelve-�gauge shotguns they also brought to the fight.<br><br>&#x201c;Although the revolver served the FBI well for several decades, it became quite evident that major changes were critical to the well-�being of our agents and American citizens,&#x201d; FBI Director William Sessions said in an agency bulletin after Miami. Revolvers held too little ammunition, and they were too difficult to reload in the heat of a gunfight. There were questions about their &#x201c;stopping power&#x201d;: In Miami, the FBI fired some seventy rounds, and Platt and Matix received a total of eighteen bullet wounds. Yet the killers stayed alive long enough to inflict a terrible toll.<br><br>In 1987, Jacksonville&#x2019;s Lieutenant Rutherford received the formal assignment to recommend a new handgun to replace the Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers that his department issued. His counterparts in hundreds of local, state, and federal police agencies were given similar missions. &#x201c;My job,&#x201d; Rutherford told me, &#x201c;was to find a better gun.&#x201d;</p><h2>Kundalini &amp; the Chakras: Evolution in this Lifetime</h2><p><p>We all possess the powerful life force of Kundalini that can open us to genius states, psychic powers, and cosmic consciousness. For over ten years, this trusted guide has been teaching people how to safely and effectively use this potent natural energy for spiritual development. This updated edition of <em>Kundalini and the Chakras</em> features all new artwork and an added index.</p> <p>Genevieve Lewis Paulson's warm, practical approach and transformative techniques for cleansing, balancing, and developing the chakras and their energies will help you realize your own tremendous creative and spiritual potential.</p></p><p>I love the type of book that can provide deeper insight into what many people consider common knowledge. That's why I like Genevieve Lewis Paulson's <i>Kundalini and the Chakras. <br> <br></i>This book contains more than just information about the chakras and the kundalini energy that flows through them. It also includes amazing secrets such as the location of hundreds of chakras all over the body. It also explains their function and symptoms of problems with them. Included are easy and safe techniques which can help you to overcome any excess or lack of energy in the chakras. <br> <br>Of course, it may be that you are not having any difficulties but simply want to keep your chakras balanced (you'll learn how, here) or develop them to a higher level (the book reveals techniques to do this), and how to charge them with the kundalini energy (instructions are included). <br> <br>If an understanding of the power centers known as chakras and the universal life energy known as kundalini hasn't been part of your spiritual system in the past, you should consider making it part of your future. Many Western spiritual systems have either adopted the chakra system and its functioning or use a modified version of it. With the information in this book you can do the same. You can use it to expand your spirituality and your knowledge of your physical and non-physical bodies. Or you may simply choose to have a deeper understanding of the chakras and kundalini and how they might correspond to your own spiritual practices. <br> <br>I have always found it interesting that many people have shared their experiences with kundalini and the chakras but few explain, in depth, how to work with them, develop them and use them. <i>Kundalini and the Chakras </i>really is different. It includes the theory and the methods for creating a healthier, happier more energetic future. I hope you will take advantage of it! <br><p><strong>Genevieve Lewis Paulson</strong> is the director and president of Dimensions of Involvement, Inc., a non-profit growth center located on 165 acres of the Ozark mountains in Arkansas, a center of psychic, personal, and spiritual learning, accrediting students in the study of Kundalini energy development. &nbsp;In the early 1970s, she founded Sunergos, Inc., a spiritual growth center in Chicago. &nbsp;Where her new experiences might have led her to abandon Western religious beliefs, she instead found a method to meld two varieties of truth, creating a synthesis of two great traditions of belief. </p></p><h2>Standard Catalog of Military Firearms, 9th Edition: The Collector&#x2019;s Price &amp; Reference Guide</h2><p><p><strong><em>Standard Catalog of Military Firearms, 9th&nbsp;Edition</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The No. 1 guide to pricing and identification of military arms and accessories from around the world.</em></strong></p> <p><em>Now in its 9th&nbsp;Edition,&nbsp;Standard Catalog of Military Firearms&nbsp;is the undisputed best source available for pricing and identification of military handguns, rifles and shotguns, as well as Class III automatic firearms and accessories such as bayonets, clips, magazines and holsters.</em></p> <p><em>Author Phillip Peterson, a renowned expert in military history and firearms, has completely updated the pricing of the more than 2,000 models of military firearms manufactured since 1870.

As a result, your dog has a reliable set of behaviors such as sit, down, stay and a recall - under pristine conditions. But now you&#39;re stumped; you&#39;re not too sure how to get those behaviors away from home and off leash - in short; when you really need cooperation! This book will help you gain cooperation under a range of circumstances and with only about ten minutes of training time per day! This book will take you through a systematic and comprehensive plan to get you where you want to be; with a reliable companion who cooperates off leash, away from home and....when other things are going on around you! This book has been split into three parts: The first part is educational. It provides information about the theory and philosophy of training. This section will be valuable for everyone, but especially if you&#39;re the kind of person who likes to know why you&#39;re doing something a certain way before you do it. The second part is practical. It&#39;s the &#34;how-to&#34; part of the book. Here, Denise lays out the plan you&#39;ll be following to help your dog respond to your cues even when the world is exciting or you don&#39;t have cookies. This portion is extremely systematic and specific. Finally, the third part is problem-solving. It will help you troubleshoot any issues that arise. In addition, if you find that you really enjoyed the training process, it will guide you in finding more opportunities for you and your dog!

Longtime LDS educator Grant H. Palmer suggests that most Latter-day Saints remain unaware of the significance of these discoveries, and he gives a brief survey for anyone who has ever wanted to know more about these issues.<br>He finds that much of what we take for granted as literal history has been tailored over the years&#x2014;slightly modified, added to, one aspect emphasized over another&#x2014;to the point that the original narratives have been nearly lost. What was experienced as a spiritual or metaphysical event, something from a different dimension, often has been refashioned as if it were a physical, objective occurrence. This is not how the first Saints interpreted these events. Historians who have looked closer at the foundational stories and source documents have restored elements, including a nineteenth-century world view, that have been misunderstood, if not forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Grant H. Palmer (M.A., American history, Brigham Young University) is a three-time director of LDS Institutes of Religion in California and Utah, a former instructor at the Church College of New Zealand, and an LDS seminary teacher at two Utah locations. He has been active in the Mormon History Association and on the board of directors of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association. He is the author of An Insider&#x2019;s View of Mormon Origins and The Incomparable Jesus. Now retired, his hobby is pigeon fancying. He has four children and eight grandchildren. He and his wife live in Sandy, Utah.&nbsp;Preface<p>For thirty-four years I was primarily an Institute director for the Church Educational System (CES) of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is much to like about the college-level discussions that sometimes occur in the Institute setting. Unfortunately, our adult lessons and discussions at church rarely rise above the seminary level, even though many of our members are well educated. Our discussions are usually an inch deep and a mile wide as they say. We seem to have a lingering desire for simple religion. We like to hear confirmations that everything is as we assumed it was: our pioneer ancestors were heroic and inspired and the Bible and Book of Mormon are in perfect harmony, for instance. We never learn in church that the Book of Abraham papyri were discovered and translated by Egyptologists or that researchers have studied Native American genes and what the implications are for the Book of Mormon. Questions about such topics are discouraged because they create tension; they are considered inappropriate or even heretical. This approach has isolated many of us from the rest of the world or from reality itself in those instances when we insist on things that are simply untrue.</p><p>All the while, such remarkable research has been conducted over the past thirty years into Mormon origins. It is exciting to see what has been done collaboratively by church historians&#x2013;the faculty of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at Brigham Young University, BYU history and religion professors and scholars from other disciplines and other church schools, and seminary and institute faculty&#x2013;and by unaffiliated scholars. Together, they have painstakingly collated and compared accounts of the most important events in church history from the original minutes and diaries; gathered data from the environment to better understand the circumstances under which activities occurred; studied the language of the revelations and scriptures and compared it to the general idiom and to literary expressions; excavated and restored sites; scoured archives; translated documents; gathered genealogical records and pursued traces of people&#x2019;s lives for additional testaments. They have published, critiqued, and re-evaluated a veritable mountain of evidence. Too much of this escapes the view of the rank-and-file in the church.</p><p>There was a day when Latter-day Saint history was considered unworthy of this kind of attention by professional historians. In large part, due to the Mormon History Association and the involvement by LDS scholars in other professional groups, this is no longer the case. Today, publishers, both academic and general interest presses, accept and publish Mormon topics on a regular basis. Yet the relatively modest print runs these books usually receive indicate that they sell mostly to other professionals rather than to the LDS public at large. There is a lingering distrust of anything that hasn&#x2019;t come directly from, or with an endorsement by, the church leadership.</p><p>Some of this research has been conducted by critics of the church. Some of it contains distortions and is unreliable. But much of what even the critics have written is backed by solid investigation and sound reasoning and should not be dismissed. Your friends don&#x2019;t always tell you what you need to hear. Furthermore, it is untrue that non-Mormons who write about the church are de facto anti-Mormon. Many outside historians are good friends and supporters of the church, and many find the topics interesting for their own sake without any agenda.</p><p>About a decade and a half ago, there was some consternation and confusion over Mark Hofmann&#x2019;s forgeries and murders. In fact, it has taken a while to sort through and correct the damage he caused. Ironically, while the LDS church supported the forgeries, two of the church&#x2019;s most visible critics never accepted their validity. Despite the setback to history caused by Hofmann, the ranks of honest and earnest historians have continued their research and writing.</p><p>Over the years, scholars of all stripes have made contributions and counterbalanced each other by critiquing each other&#x2019;s works. We now have a body of authentic, reliable documents and a near-consensus on many of the details. From this base, the overall picture of Mormon origins begins to unfold. This picture is much different from what we hear in the modified versions that are taught in Sunday school. But de-mythologized&#x2013;placed in its original time and place, amid all the twists and turns that exist in the real world&#x2013;it rings true. There has not been an attempt to eliminate the spiritual from the secular. Far from that, the foundational stories are in many cases more spiritual, less temporal, and more stirring. Whatever else, they are also fascinating. To know the personalities involved in these events and to hear them tell their experiences in their own original words before everything was recast for hierarchical and proselyting purposes is to see it all in an entirely new and exciting perspective.</p><p>That said, I have wondered how I should introduce my work. How should I convey what I feel in my soul? First, this book is not intended for children or investigators. So much of our attention is directed toward children and potential converts that long-standing adult members rarely have an opportunity to speak freely to each other. We worry that tender ears may overhear. I am a fourth-generation Mormon, and I want to address this discussion to other second-, third-, and fourth-generation Mormons who will better understand where I am coming from. Lest there be any question, let me say that my intent is to increase faith, not to diminish it. Still, faith needs to be built on truth&#x2013;what is, in fact, true and believable. After that comes the great leap. We too often confuse faith with knowledge. Faith has to do with the unknown, not about what can be proven or can be shown to be reasonably based on the evidence. I have always thought that an unwillingness to submit one&#x2019;s beliefs to rigorous scrutiny is a manifestation of weakness of faith. Otherwise, everything becomes a matter of orthodoxy rather than truth.</p><p>These are matters that I wrestled with for years. As a young man, I became involved in CES because of my commitment to the gospel and my love of the scriptures and also because of my passion for church history. These remain priorities today. I see a number of things differently now than I did before I embarked on this lifelong study of, and service to, the church. I volunteered toward the end of my career to be the LDS Institute director at the Salt Lake County jail. I looked forward to focusing on basic Bible teachings and doing some counseling. I also hoped that I might resolve some of my own questions in an atmosphere where I could freely contemplate them. Now that I am retired, I find myself compelled to discuss in public what I pondered mostly in private at that time.</p><p>I have two purposes in writing. One is to introduce church members who have not followed the developments in church history during the last thirty years to issues that are central to the topic of Mormon origins. I hope my survey will be enlightening and useful to anyone who has wanted to understand what has been termed the New Mormon History.</p><p>Second, I would like church members to understand historians and religion teachers like myself. When I or my colleagues talk or write about the LDS past, we tend to avoid superlatives that members expect when hearing a recital of our history. Their ears finely tuned to the nuances of such parlance, they assume that we have secularized the story, that we are intentionally obtuse, or that we split hairs. They have heard that we are revisionists, and by this they understand that we are rewriting history in a way that was never intended. In truth, we are salvaging the earliest, authentic versions of these stories from the ravages of well-meaning censors who have abridged and polished them for institutional purposes.</p><p>Wallace B. Smith, president-emeritus of the RLDS church (now the Community of Christ), writing about &#x201c;the foundation experiences&#x201d; of Mormonism, observed: &#x201c;One thing is clear. The genie is out of the bottle and it cannot be put back. Facts uncovered and the questions raised by the new Mormon historians will not go away. They will have to be dealt with if we are to maintain a position of honesty and integrity in our dealings with our own members as well as our friends in the larger religious community.&#x201d;1&nbsp;I find this position to be both refreshing and healthy. I also agree with Thomas Jefferson who taught that however discomfiting a free exchange may be, truth will ultimately emerge the victor.2&nbsp;President Hugh B. Brown, a counselor in the LDS presidency during the 1960s, echoed on behalf of the church:</p><p>I admire men and women who have developed the questing spirit, who are unafraid of new ideas as stepping stones to progress. We should, of course, respect the opinions of others, but we should also be unafraid to dissent&#x2013;if we are informed. Thoughts and expressions compete in the marketplace of thought, and in that competition truth emerges triumphant. Only error fears freedom of expression ... This free exchange of ideas is not to be deplored as long as men and women remain humble and teachable. Neither fear of consequence or any kind of coercion should ever be used to secure uniformity of thought in the church. People should express their problems and opinions and be unafraid to think without fear of ill consequences. ... We must preserve freedom of the mind in the church and resist all efforts to suppress it.3</p><p>These and similar sentiments motivate me in my current endeavor. I do not believe that what I have written is flawless, but I lay out the evidence and state the implications of what I see as clearly as possible. My years of teaching have taught me that if I am not direct, my point is missed. However, there is also a downside to such straightforwardness. If I seem provocative or insensitive, or if I offend, it is not my intention. These are issues that are deeply important to me. I do not treat them lightly, whatever the shortcomings of my prose. Yet, I feel good that I do not cloak the issues in ambiguities, with an overdose of qualifiers and disclaimers. I find these matters to be so engaging that, for me, they bring church history to life for the first time. If nothing else, the reader may sense my enthusiasm, which can be boundless, I admit.</p><p>Perhaps the reader is already puzzled by this lengthy dialogue on historiography and freedom of belief. If so, let me state clearly what can be expected from this book. I, along with colleagues, and drawing from years of research, find the evidence employed to support many traditional claims about the church to be either nonexistent or problematic. In other words, it didn&#x2019;t all happen the way we&#x2019;ve been told. For the sake of accuracy and honesty, I think we need to address and ultimately correct this disparity between historical narratives and the inspirational stories that are told in church. Hopefully my book will be received in the spirit in which it is intended. As English philosopher John Stuart Mill said, any attempt to resist another opinion is a &#x201c;peculiar evil.&#x201d; If the opinion is right, we are robbed of the &#x201c;opportunity of exchanging error for truth.&#x201d; If it is wrong, we are deprived of a deeper understanding of the truth in &#x201c;its collision with error.&#x201d;4</p><p>On 4-5 January 1922, B. H. Roberts, senior president of the church&#x2019;s seven presidents of the seventy, presented to ranking church leaders what he called &#x201c;Book of Mormon Difficulties&#x201d; discussed in chapter two of this book. Elder Roberts said: &#x201c;In a church which claimed continuous revelation, a crisis had arisen where revelation was necessary.&#x201d; He hoped his brethren would bring &#x201c;the inspiration of the Lord&#x201d; to solve these problems. However, after his presentations, his colleagues reaffirmed their testimonies of the Book of Mormon and offered no solutions.5</p><p>I would like to renew Elder Roberts&#x2019;s call for a more candid discussion of the foundations of the church beginning with the Book of Mormon. I discuss these issues in eight chapters, the first of which evaluates Joseph Smith&#x2019;s efforts at translation. Chapters 2-4 examine Joseph&#x2019;s intellectual environment, including the King James Bible, evangelical religion, and American antiquities, all of which influenced the content of the Book of Mormon. Chapter 4 also discusses religious feelings and the Holy Ghost. Chapters 5-6 reveal the impact of folk beliefs on two early claims of Mormonism. Chapters 7-8 investigate priesthood restoration and Joseph&#x2019;s first vision, detailing the developments and what precipitated the changes in the history of these two experiences.</p><p>I wish to thank my friends and colleagues who agreed to be readers of my first and subsequent drafts for their many helpful suggestions and encouragement. It is good to have critics, but it is also good to have such reassuring friends.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy</h2><p>This book is an introduction in the very best sense of the word. It provides the beginner with an accurate, sophisticated, yet accessible account, and offers new insights and challenging perspectives to those who have more specialized knowledge. Focusing on the period in Chinese philosophy that is surely most easily approachable and perhaps is most important, it ranges over of rich set of competing options. It also, with admirable self-consciousness, presents a number of daring attempts to relate those options to philosophical figures and movements from the West. I recommend it very highly.--Lee H. Yearley, Walter Y. Evans-Wentz Professor, Religious Studies, Stanford University</p><p><p> Bryan W. Van Norden is Professor in the Philosophy Department, and in the department of Chinese and Japanese, at Vassar College.</p>This lucid introduction to early Chinese thought offers historical, textual and conceptual analyses of the schools of Classical Chinese philosophy, illuminating their basic themes, theories, and arguments and providing readers with an intellectual bridge between Chinese and Western thought. Introductory texts such as this are especially needed today, as the study of philosophy faces the challenges of globalization and the urgent need for dialogue among different philosophical traditions. An ideal text for introductory courses, this book will also inspire graduate students, scholars and experts in philosophy in general, and Chinese Philosophy in particular, with its theoretical insights and comparative methodology. --Vincent Shen, Lee Chair in Chinese Thought and Culture, Departments of Philosophy and East Asian Studies, University of Toronto<br><br><p>A substantial and highly accessible introduction to the indigenous philosophies of China. Van Norden shares his clear distillations of classical Chinese philosophies using conceptual frameworks many will find familiar. This reader-friendly book sets the historical and cultural contexts for the philosophies discussed, and includes appendices, study questions, and imaginative scenarios, which aid us in appreciating some of the most important philosophy ever developed. --Ann Pirruccello, Professor of Philosophy, University of San Diego</p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Alchemy: The Magic and Mystery of the Ancient Craft Revealed for Today (Complete Idiot&#39;s Guides (Lifestyle Paperback))</h2><p><b><i>More than magic...</i></b> <br><br> Where else can one combine chemistry and philosophy to turn base metal into gold while discovering a magical elixir to prolong life?

Nice and slick, two in front, one big cover-man behind in a three-point close while I was reaching for my car door. Nothing flashy, just three big guys in off-the-rack gray, all of them sweating in the Ocean City heat.</strong></p><p><strong>The pointman held up his hands in a no-problem gesture. It was a hot Saturday morning and I was in swim-trunks and a Hawaiian shirt with mermaids on it over a Tom Petty t-shirt. Flip-flops and Wayfarers. My piece was in a locked toolbox in the trunk, with a trigger guard clamped on it. I was at the beach to look at this year&#x2019;s crop of sun-bunnies and I&#x2019;d been off the clock since the shooting pending a Monday morning officer-involved discussion with the OIS team. It had been a bad scene at the warehouse and they&#x2019;d put me on administrative leave to give me time to get my head straight about the shootings. I wasn&#x2019;t expecting trouble, there shouldn&#x2019;t have <em>been</em> trouble, and the smooth way these guys boxed me was designed to keep everyone&#x2019;s emotions in neutral. I couldn&#x2019;t have done it better myself.</strong></p><p><strong>"Mr. Ledger...?"</strong></p><p><strong>"Detective Ledger," I said to be pissy.</strong></p><p><strong>No trace of a smile on the point-guy&#x2019;s face, only a millimeter of a nod. He had a head like a bucket.</strong></p><p><strong>"We&#x2019;d like you to come with us," he said.</strong></p><p><strong>"Badge me or buzz off."</strong></p><p><strong>Bucket-head gave me <em>the look</em>, but he pulled out an FBI identification case and held it up. I stopped reading after the initials.</strong></p><p><strong>"What&#x2019;s this about?"</strong></p><p><strong>"Would you come with us, please?"</strong></p><p><strong>"I&#x2019;m off the clock, guys, what&#x2019;s this about?"</strong></p><p><strong>No answer.</strong></p><p><strong>"Are you aware that I&#x2019;m scheduled to start at Quantico in three weeks?"</strong></p><p><strong>No answer.</strong></p><p><strong>"You want me to follow you in my car?" Not that I wanted to try and give these fellows the slip, but my cell was in the glove box of the SUV and it would be nice to check in with the lieutenant on this one. It had a weird feel to it. Not exactly threatening, just weird.</strong></p><p><strong>"No, sir, we&#x2019;ll bring you back here after."</strong></p><p><strong>"After what?"</strong></p><p><strong>No answer.</strong></p><p><strong>I looked at him and then the guy next to him. I could feel the cover-man behind me. They were big, they were nicely set &#x2013;even with peripheral vision I could see that Bucket-head had his weight on the balls of his feet and evenly balanced. The other front-man was shifted to his right. He had big knuckles but his hands weren&#x2019;t scarred. Probably boxing rather than martial arts; boxers wear gloves.</strong></p><p><strong>They were doing almost everything right except that they were a little too close to me. You should never get that close. </strong></p><p><strong>But they looked like the real deal. It&#x2019;s hard to fake the FBI look.</strong></p><p><strong>"Okay," I said.</strong></p><p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p><p><strong>Ocean City<strong>, Maryland<strong> / Saturday, June 27; 10:31 am</strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong>Bucket-head sat beside me in the back and the other two sat up front, the cover-man driving the big government Crown Vic. For all the conversation going on the others might have been mimes. The air conditioner was turned up and the radio was turned off. Exciting.</strong></p><p><strong>"I hope we&#x2019;re not going all the way the hell back to Baltimore." That was more than a three-hour ride and I had sand in my shorts.</strong></p><p><strong>"No." That was the only word Bucket-head said on the ride. I settled back to wait. </strong></p><p><strong>I could tell that he was a leftie from the bulge his shoulder rig made. He kept me on his right side, which meant that his coat flap would impede me grabbing his piece and he could use his right hand as a block to fend me off while he drew. It was professional and well thought out. I&#x2019;d have done almost the same thing. What I wouldn&#x2019;t have done, though, was hold onto the leather handstrap by the door like he was doing. It was the second small mistake he made and I had to wonder if he was testing me or whether there was a little gap between his training and his instincts. </strong></p><p><strong>I settled back and tried to understand this pick-up. If this had something to do with the action last week on the docks, if I was somehow in trouble for something related to that, then I sure as hell planned to lawyer up when we got wherever we were going. And I wanted a union rep there, too. No way this was SOP. Unless it was some Homeland thing, in which case I&#x2019;d lawyer up <em>and</em> call my congressman. That warehouse thing was righteous and I wasn&#x2019;t going to let anyone say different.</strong></p><p><strong>For the last eighteen months I&#x2019;d been attached to one of those interjurisdictional taskforces that have popped up everywhere post 9/11. A few of us from Baltimore PD, some Philly and DC guys, and a mixed bag of Feds: FBI, NSA, ATF, and a few letter combinations I hadn&#x2019;t seen before.

The first of three volumes, Anthem puts the band&#x2019;s catalog, from their self-titled debut to 1978&#x2019;s Hemispheres (the next volume resumes with the release of Permanent Waves) into both Canadian and general pop culture context, and presents the trio of quintessentially dependable, courteous Canucks as generators of incendiary, groundbreaking rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.</p> <p>Fighting complacency, provoking thought, and often enraging critics, Rush has been at war with the music industry since 1974, when they were first dismissed as the Led Zeppelin of the north. Anthem, like each volume in this series, celebrates the perseverance of Geddy, Alex, and Neil: three men who maintained their values while operating from a Canadian base, throughout lean years, personal tragedies, and the band&#x2019;s eventual worldwide success.</p></p><p><b>Martin Popoff</b> has written more than 80 books, including three on Rush. He has also worked on various projects for Banger Films, including the award-winning Rush documentary, Beyond the Lighted Stage. Popoff has published more record reviews in books &#x2015; approximately 7,900 &#x2015; than anybody in history.<p></p><p>Like Geezer Butler in Black Sabbath, to reiterate, Geddy indeed began on guitar. Alex, however, missed this part of Lee&#x2019;s evolution.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know Ged when he played guitar. So the transition was already completed by the time we started jamming together and playing. Because that&#x2019;s what we did after school. We&#x2019;d plug into his amp and play. There was one guitar and one bass. So I&#x2019;m not really sure about that transition. I&#x2019;m sure he was interested in guitar like everybody was interested in guitar. But once we actually started playing and learning instruments, that was his chosen one. Just think John Rutsey in that early days&#x2015;the drums became his thing but I don&#x2019;t know if in his heart he wanted to be a drummer. I think he wanted to be a guitarist as well. But everybody had their job that they sort of gravitated to.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>Says Geddy, &#x201c;I was nominated to be the bass player when the first band I was in, the bass player couldn&#x2019;t be in our band. I think his parent&#x2019;s prohibited him or something, and we had no bass player so they said, &#x2018;You play bass&#x2019; and I said okay, and that was how simple it was. That happens to a lot of bass players. Everyone wants to be a guitar player, but I was happy to be bass player. Bass player is like being a major league catcher. It&#x2019;s the quickest way to the majors. Nobody wants to be a bass player. It&#x2019;s a great instrument, it really is, awesome way to spend your time. I had teachers you know; I&#x2019;m just carrying on the tradition of Jack Bruce, Jack Cassidy, Chris Squire, a fine tradition of noisy bass players that refuse to stay in the background. So I feel that&#x2019;s my sacred duty, to carry on what they started.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Flash (The Puppy Place #6)</h2><p>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!<br><br> Charles and Lizzie Peterson love puppies.

This is the story of the first battle in that war of ideas, a battle that led to the writing of the First Amendment and that continues to define the issue of the separation of church and state today. It began with religious persecution and ended in revolution, and along the way it defined the nature of America and of individual liberty. Acclaimed historian John M. Barry explores the development of these fundamental ideas through the story of Roger Williams, who was the first to link religious freedom to individual liberty, and who created in America the first government and society on earth informed by those beliefs. This book is essential to understanding the continuing debate over the role of religion and political power in modern life.</p></p><p><b>John M.

Present-day implications of an elemental clash of ideas may hover over every page, yet the vital drama of Barry&#x2019;s story emblazons two competing visions of American destiny: John Winthrop&#x2019;s &#x201c;city on a hill&#x201d; vs. Williams&#x2019;s community of conscience. As Barry shows well and often prophetically, the national soul formed out of that drama remains a troubled, and occasionally tortured, one." &#x2014; <b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"To call it a biography sells it short. What it is, really, is the history of an idea<i>&#x2014;</i>about the critical importance of separating church from state. So revolutionary was this idea that it caused Williams to be banished from Massachusetts. . . . Williams created the first place in the Western world where people could believe in any God they wished<i>&#x2014;</i>or no God at all<i>&#x2014;</i>without fear of retribution." &#x2014; <b>Joe Nocera, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"In <i>Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul</i>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John M. Barry tells the story with passion and an eye for fine detail. . . . If the story were not compelling enough, Barry's dramatic first chapter of conflict, confrontation and banishment into the wilderness is worth the price of admission alone. . . . As Barry notes, the dispute 'opened a fissure in America, a fault line which would rive America all the way to the present.' John Barry deserves our thanks for illuminating this critical and timely chapter of American history." &#x2014; <b><i>The Seattle Times</i></b><br><br>"There's a recurring theme among the religiously political/politically religious that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and that in this modern era we have somehow strayed from God and from our roots. John M. Barry's new book <i>Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul: Church, State, and the Birth of Liberty</i> is a counterargument and it is a significant reminder of whence, exactly, this little experiment in democracy of ours came . . . Absorbing." &#x2014; <b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>"This biography should be read with today's headlines in mind . . . Thoroughly researched and accessibly written . . . This is an important book because it brings back an important founding point in the development of the American character. But it also is a timely reminder that the issues that drove Williams into exile in Rhode Island are very much alive and just as perilous today." &#x2014; <b><i>The Washington Times</i></b><br>"Fascinating... a swath of history Barry brings to urgent life with the same focused intelligence which distinguished <i>The Great Influenza."</i> &#x2014; <b>Booklist</b><br>"A commanding history...masterly." &#x2014; <b>Library Journal</b></p><h2>Hug Me</h2><p>Ever feel like you need a hug, a really big hug from someone?

Whether she writes of the loss of a friend, Cesare Pavese; or what is inexpugnable of World War II; or the Abruzzi, where she and her first husband lived in forced residence under Fascist rule; or the importance of silence in our society; or her vocation as a writer; or even a pair of worn-out shoes, Ginzburg brings to her reflections the wisdom of a survivor and the spare, wry, and poetically resonant style her readers have come to recognize. <br><br>"A glowing light of modern Italian literature . . . Ginzburg's magic is the utter simplicity of her prose, suddenly illuminated by one word that makes a lightning streak of a plain phrase. . . . As direct and clean as if it were carved in stone, it yet speaks thoughts of the heart.' &#x2014; <i>The New York Times</i> Book Review</p><p>Natalia Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Italy in 1916. She was an Italian author whose work explored family relationships, politics during and after the Fascist years and World War II, and philosophy. She wrote novels, short stories and essays, for which she received the Strega Prize and Bagutta Prize. Modest and intensely reserved, Ginzburg never shied away from the traumas of history, whether writing about the Turin of her childhood, the Abruzzi countryside or contemporary Rome&#x2014;all the while approaching those traumas only indirectly, through the mundane details and catastrophes of personal life. Most of her works were also translated into English and published in the United Kingdom and United States. She wrote acclaimed translations of both Proust and Flaubert into Italian. She died in Rome in 1991.<b>Praise for <i>The Little Virtues</i></b><br><br> "A stunning <i>tour de force</i>, <i>The Little Virtues</i> is a credo of undaunted idealism." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "There is one book . . .which has meant more to me than any other: <i>The Little Virtues,</i> by the Italian novelist, essayist, playwright, short-story writer, translator, and political activist Natalia Ginzburg." &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker,</i> September&nbsp;2016<br><br> "Now reading Natalia Ginzburg's <i>The Little Virtues</i> and my life is already better."&#x2014;Rosanne Cash, Grammy award-winning singer/songwriter and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Composed: A Memoir</i><br><br> &#x201c;A book of beautiful short pieces.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i>, July 2019<br><br> "The book that taught me what I want to teach my daughter." &#x2014;Belle Boggs, author of <i>Mattaponi Queen</i><br><br> "Considered among the best writers in contemporary Italy, Ginzburg should appeal to a wide American audience with this collection of essays." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "These little virtues then, this little book, pack a tremendous punch.

My classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day. It was one of the first big words we learned.&nbsp; Impedimenta&#x2014;the baggage that impedes one&#x2019;s progress. So I was Joe Impedimenta. Or Dash. A lot of people thought they called me Dash because of football. I was fast, and I scored my share of touchdowns. But the guys at an all-boys Catholic school usually didn&#x2019;t give you nicknames to make you feel better about yourself. They didn&#x2019;t call me Dash because of what I could do on the football field; they called me Dash because of what I could not do in the classroom. I talked like Morse code. Dot-dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dash. &#x201c;You gu-gu-gu-gu-guys sh-sh-sh-sh-shut up!&#x201d; <br>My impedimenta was a stutter. It wasn&#x2019;t always bad. When I was at home with my brothers and sister, hanging out with my neighborhood friends, or shooting the bull on the ball field, I was fine, but when I got thrown into a new situation or a new school, had to read in front of the class, or wanted to ask out a girl, I just couldn&#x2019;t do it. My freshman year of high school, because of the stutter, I got an exemption from public speaking. Everybody else had to get up and make a presentation at the morning assembly, in front of 250 boys. I got a pass. And everybody knew it. Maybe they didn&#x2019;t think much of it&#x2014;they had other things to worry about&#x2014;but I did. It was like having to stand in the corner with the dunce cap. Other kids looked at me like I was stupid. They laughed. I wanted so badly to prove I was like everybody else. Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening. There were times I thought it was the end of the world, my impedimenta. I worried that the stutter was going to be my epitaph. And there were days I wondered: How would I ever beat it?<br> It&#x2019;s a funny thing to say, but even if I could, I wouldn&#x2019;t wish away the darkest days of the stutter. That impedimenta ended up being a godsend for me. Carrying it strengthened me and, I hoped, made me a better person. And the very things it taught me turned out to be invaluable lessons for my life as well as my chosen career. <br><br>I started worrying about my stutter back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in grade school. When I was in kindergarten, my parents sent me to a speech pathologist at Marywood College, but it didn&#x2019;t help much, so I went only a few times. Truth was, I didn&#x2019;t let the stutter get in the way of things that really mattered to me. I was young for my grade and always little for my age, but I made up for it by demonstrating I had guts. On a dare, I&#x2019;d climb to the top of a burning culm dump, swing out over a construction site, race under a moving dump truck. If I could visualize myself doing it, I knew I could do it. It never crossed my mind that I couldn&#x2019;t. As much as I lacked confidence in my ability to communicate verbally, I always had confidence in my athletic ability. Sports was as natural to me as speaking was unnatural. And sports turned out to be my ticket to acceptance&#x2014;and more. I wasn&#x2019;t easily intimidated in a game, so even when I stuttered, I was always the kid who said, &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; <br>Who&#x2019;s going to take the last shot? &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; We need a touchdown now. &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d be eight years old, usually the smallest guy on the field, but I wanted the ball. And they gave it to me. <br>When I was ten, we moved from the Scranton neighborhood I knew so well to Wilmington, Delaware. My dad was having trouble finding a good job in Scranton, and his brother Frank kept telling him there were jobs in Wilmington. The Biden brothers had spent most of their school days in Wilmington, so it was like going home for my dad. For the rest of us, it felt like leaving home. But my mom, who was born and raised in Scranton, determined to see it as my dad did; she refused to see it any other way. This was a wonderful opportunity. We&#x2019;d have a fresh start. We&#x2019;d make new friends. We were moving into a brand-new neighborhood, to a brand-new home. This wasn&#x2019;t a hand-me-down house. We&#x2019;d be the first people to ever set foot in it. It was all good. She was like that with my stutter, too. She wouldn&#x2019;t dwell on the bad stuff. Joey, you&#x2019;re so handsome. Joey, you&#x2019;re such a good athlete. Joey, you&#x2019;ve got such a high IQ. You&#x2019;ve got so much to say, honey, that your brain gets ahead of you. And if the other kids made fun of me, well, that was their problem. They&#x2019;re just jealous. <br>She knew how wounding kids could be. One thing she determined to do when we moved to Wilmington was hold me back a year. Besides being young and small, I&#x2019;d missed a lot of school the last year in Scranton when I&#x2019;d had my tonsils and adenoids removed. So when we got to Wilmington, my mom insisted I do third grade over&#x2014;and none of the kids at Holy Rosary had to know I was being held back by my mom. That was just another of the ways Wilmington would be a fresh start. <br>Actually, we were moving to the outskirts of Wilmington, to a working-class neighborhood called the Claymont area, just across the Pennsylvania state line. I still remember the drive into Delaware. It all felt like an adventure. My dad was at the wheel and my mom was up front with him, with the three of us kids in back: me, my brother, Jimmy, and my six-year-old sister, Valerie, who was also my best friend. We drove across the state line on the Philadelphia Turnpike, past the Worth Steel Mill, the General Chemical Company, and the oil refineries, all spewing smoke. We drove past Worthland and Overlook Colony, tightly packed with the row houses that the mills had built for their workers not long after the turn of the century. Worthland was full of Italians and Poles; Overlook Colony was black. It was just a mile or so down the road to Brookview Apartments and our brand-new garden unit. A right off the Philadelphia Pike, and we were home. <br>Brookview was a moonscape. A huge water tower loomed over the development, but there wasn&#x2019;t a tree in sight. We followed the main road in as it swept us in a gentle curve. Off the main road were the &#x201c;courts.&#x201d; One side was built, but the other was still under construction. We could see the heavy machinery idling among the mounds of dirt and red clay. It was a hot summer day, so our car windows were rolled down. I can still remember the smell of that red clay, the sulfurous stink from the bowels of the earth. As we arced down the main street toward a new home, my mom caught sight of these airless little one-story apartments. They were the color of brown mustard. My dad must have seen my mom&#x2019;s face as she scanned her new neighborhood. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Pudd&#x2019;,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not these. We have a big one.&#x201d; <br>He pulled the car around to the bottom of a bend, and without getting out of the car, he pointed across an expanse of not-quite lawn, toward the big one. Our new home was a two-story unit, white, with thin columns in front&#x2014;a hint of Tara, I guess&#x2014;and a one-story box off each side. &#x201c;There it is,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;All of this?&#x201d; Mom asked. <br>&#x201c;No, just the center,&#x201d; my dad said. Then, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Pudd&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s only temporary.&#x201d; <br>From the backseat I could tell my mom was crying.<br> &#x201c;Mom!? What&#x2019;s the matter, Mommy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just so happy. Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful? Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful?&#x201d; <br><br>Actually, it didn&#x2019;t seem bad to me. It was a miniature version of a center hall colonial, and we had bedrooms upstairs. I had the bedroom in back, which meant from my window I could gaze upon the object of my deepest desire, my Oz: Archmere. Right in the middle of this working-class steel town, not a mile from the mills and directly across from the entrance of Brookview Apartments, was the first mansion I had ever really seen. I could look at it for hours. John Jacob Raskob had built the house for his family before the steel mills, chemical plants, and oil refineries came to Claymont. Raskob was Pierre du Pont&#x2019;s personal secretary, but he had a genius for making money out of money. He convinced the du Ponts to take a big stake in General Motors and became its chairman of finance. Raskob was also a Catholic hero. He used part of his fortune to fund a charitable foundation, and he&#x2019;d run the campaign of the first Catholic presidential nominee, the Democrat Al Smith. In 1928 the Democrats had political strategy sessions in his library at Archmere. Raskob went on to build the Empire State Building. <br>The mansion he built in Claymont, the Patio at Archmere, was a magnificent Italianate marble pile on a property that sloped down to the Delaware River. Archmere&#x2014;arch by the sea&#x2014;was named for the arch of elms that ran on that slope to the river. But after the working man&#x2019;s families, not to mention the noise and pollution from the mills, began to crowd the Patio, Raskob cut his losses and sold the mansion to an order of Catholic priests. The Norbertines turned it into a private boys&#x2019; school. Archmere Academy was just twenty years old when I moved in across the street. <br>When I played CYO football that year, our coach was Dr. Anzelotti, a Ph.D. chemist at DuPont who had sons at the school. Archmere let Dr. Anzelotti run our practices on the grounds of the school. From the moment I got within the ten-foot-high wrought-iron fence that surrounded the campus and drove up the road&#x2014;they actually called it the yellow-brick road&#x2014;I knew where I wanted to go to high school. I didn&#x2019;t ever think of Archmere as a path to greater glory. When I was ten, getting to Archmere seemed enough. I&#x2019;d sit and stare out my bedroom window and dream of the day I would walk through the front doors and take my spot in that seat of learning. I&#x2019;d dream of the day I would score the touchdown or hit the game-winning home run.<br><br>I entered third grade at Holy Rosary, a Catholic school half a mile down the Philadelphia Pike where the Sisters of Saint Joseph eased me into my new world. They were the link between Scranton and Claymont. Wherever there were nuns, there was home. I&#x2019;m as much a cultural Catholic as I am a theological Catholic. My idea of self, of family, of community, of the wider world comes straight from my religion. It&#x2019;s not so much the Bible, the beatitudes, the Ten Commandments, the sacraments, or the prayers I learned. It&#x2019;s the culture. The nuns are one of the reasons I&#x2019;m still a practicing Catholic. Last summer in Dubuque, Iowa, a local political ally, Teri Goodmann, took me to the Saint Francis Convent&#x2014;a beautiful old building that looked like it belonged on an Ivy League campus. On the way over we&#x2019;d stopped by the Hy-Vee to buy some ice cream for the sisters, because Jean Finnegan Biden&#x2019;s son does not visit nuns empty-handed. It reminded me of grade school, of the last day before the holidays when all my classmates would be presenting their little Christmas offerings to the nun. The desk would be a mound of little specialty soaps. (What else do you get a nun?) The sisters smelled like lavender the rest of the year. I don&#x2019;t remember a nun not smelling like lavender. <br>So I walked into the Dubuque convent with several gallons of ice cream and immediately began to worry we hadn&#x2019;t brought enough. Teri was expecting ten or twelve of the sisters to show up for the event, but there must have been four dozen nuns&#x2014;many of them from the generation that taught me as a boy&#x2014;sitting in a community room. I was there to give a talk about the situation in Iraq, and the sisters really wanted to understand the sectarian conflict there. They peppered me with questions about the Sunnis, the Shi&#x2019;ites, and the Kurds. They wanted to know about the history of the religion the Kurds practice, and they wanted to know how I educated myself about the concerns of the Iraqi people. Many of these nuns had been teachers; knowledge mattered most. We also talked about our own church, then about women&#x2019;s issues, education, and national security. Whether they agreed with my public positions or not, they all smiled at me. Even after we opened up the ice cream, they kept asking questions. And as I was getting ready to leave Teri asked if the sisters would, in the days ahead, pray for Joe Biden&#x2019;s success in his public journey. But they did more than that. The sisters formed a circle around me, raised their arms up over my head, and started singing the blessing they give to one of their own who is going off to do God&#x2019;s work in the next place. &#x201c;May God bless you and keep you.&#x201d; The sisters were so sweet and so genuine that it made me feel the way I did when I was a kid, like I was in touch with something bigger than me. It wasn&#x2019;t any epiphany, wasn&#x2019;t any altar call. It was where I&#x2019;ve always been. The Sisters of Saint Francis in Dubuque, Iowa, were taking me home. <br>The nuns were my first teachers. At Holy Rosary, like at Saint Paul&#x2019;s in Scranton, they taught reading and writing and math and geography and history, but embedded in the curriculum also were the concepts of decency, fair play, and virtue. They took as a starting point the biblical exhortation that man has no greater love than to lay down his life for another man; in school we were about ten clicks back from that. You didn&#x2019;t give your life, but it was noble to help a lady across the street. It was noble to offer a hand up to somebody who had less. It was noble to step in when the bully was picking on somebody. It was noble to intervene.</p><h2>The Sequence of Events in the Old Testament</h2><p>The Bible laid out geographically and chronologically with detailed maps, charts and genealogies.

The motorcar happened to be driven by the Duke of York, the man who would one day be king of England. But our Thelma didn&#x2019;t care a fig about that. All she knew was that she had lost her beloved friend, the light of her life. And her heart was broken. <br> The duke, as you can imagine, felt terrible. With deepest sympathies, he wrote to Thelma&#x2019;s parents and offered to purchase a new dog for the family. Her parents felt Thelma was too grief-stricken to accept another dog. Ever so politely, they turned down the duke&#x2019;s generous offer and let Thelma know that they had done so. After a few months, when Thelma&#x2019;s heart had mended, she wrote the duke a letter. She&#x2019;d take that new dog now, thank you very much, she told him. But the duke, not wanting to go against the parents&#x2019; original wishes, declined to make good on his offer.<br> There would be no new dog for Thelma at this time. But she soldiered on and eventually grew up to be one of the most famous dog breeders in all of England. At the kennel she founded&#x2014;known as Rozavel&#x2014;she raised many a prizewinner. Among them were Alsatians, Scotties, Airedales, chow chows, and Chihuahuas. But her very favorite breed was the corgi. And while she didn&#x2019;t, strictly speaking, discover corgis, her work did go a long way toward making us famous and getting us officially recognized by the Kennel Club.<br> Thelma encountered her first corgi as a young gal on holiday in Wales. From the window of her roadster, she saw one dashing across a field on his short but sturdy legs, expertly herding cattle by nipping at their heels. Welsh farmers had been breeding corgis to herd for hundreds of years. What did we herd? Anything that needed herding: sheep, geese, ducks, horses, cattle, sometimes even the farmers&#x2019; wayward children. It was from these same farmers that Thelma purchased the very finest specimens of our kind, with an eye to starting her own line. At Rozavel, she set about breeding two types of corgis: the Pembroke Welsh corgi (smaller and with a naturally bobbed tail) and the Cardigan Welsh corgi (bigger than the Pembroke and with a long tail).<br> So successful was she in her efforts in the 1930s that her Pem stud, Red Dragon, became quite the dog about- town. Thelma sold one of his excellent pups to a member of the royal family, Viscount Weymouth. Now, the viscount&#x2019;s children happened to be playmates with the young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose&#x2014;the daughters of the very same Duke of York who had crossed paths with Thelma as a child! The young princesses were so smitten with the viscount&#x2019;s corgi that they begged their father for one of their own. In short order, the duke summoned Thelma to his residence. She came bearing three charming Pembroke Welsh corgi pups, from which the children were to pick one.<br> Did Thelma let on to the duke that she was the same little girl whose dog he had run over all those years ago? Like a mysterious stranger in a fairy tale, she chose to keep her identity a secret. After all, that had been a lifetime ago. In this lifetime, breeding superb dogs and finding outstanding homes for them were what interested her.<br> Naturally, the princesses wanted to keep all three of the pups. But that was not going to happen. Not even princesses get to have everything they wish for. So after much snuggling and soul-searching and royal dithering, they chose Rozavel Golden Eagle. The way I heard it, Golden Eagle became so stuck-up and full of himself from being the pet of princesses that the staff took to calling him &#x201c;the Duke.&#x201d; The girls, delighted with the nickname, dubbed him Dookie. Three years later, Dookie was joined by a second corgi from Thelma&#x2019;s kennel, Lady Jane. Lady Jane and Elizabeth&#x2014;known as Lilibet to those nearest and dearest&#x2014;soon became inseparable. The most adorable little book titled Our Princesses and Their Dogs came out just in time for Christmas 1936. It was a picture book full of photographs of Elizabeth and Margaret Rose frolicking with their beloved corgis and other royal dogs.<br> The same month of the book&#x2019;s publication, the Duke of York ascended to the throne of England. When the people of England looked upon the pictures in this book, they saw a family with a keen attachment to and understanding of dogs. They knew that their king was a fine master, a good father, and a gentle man. Thanks in part to dogs, the people of England welcomed with open arms their new king, George VI.<br> Three years later, in 1939, a terrible war broke out between England and Germany. Enemy bombs fell throughout the land, destroying property and taking lives. As an example to their subjects, the king and queen chose to remain in London in the royal residence, Buckingham Palace. The princesses were sent off to the country, to Windsor Castle, behind whose stout stone walls they were kept safe. Watching over them were the officers of the Grenadier Guards, whose job it is to protect the royal family&#x2014;and the royal corgis as well, although by now there was just one. Dookie had died of old age at the start of the war. Fortunately, Thelma found a mate for Lady Jane, and she soon gave birth to Crackers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Graphic Clay: Ceramic Surfaces &amp; Printed Image Transfer Techniques</h2><p>For studio artists, production potters, students, educators, and hobbyists who love working with clay, this project-driven guide is an unmatched teaching tool and a fount of information and inspiration.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.</p><p>Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.</p><p>The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.</p><p>In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.</p><p>Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, <i>On Intelligence</i> promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity.</p></p><p>Jeff Hawkins, the high-tech success story behind PalmPilots and the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, does a lot of thinking about thinking. In <i>On Intelligence</i> Hawkins juxtaposes his two loves--computers and brains--to examine the real future of artificial intelligence. In doing so, he unites two fields of study that have been moving uneasily toward one another for at least two decades. Most people think that computers are getting smarter, and that maybe someday, they'll be as smart as we humans are. But Hawkins explains why the way we build computers today won't take us down that path. He shows, using nicely accessible examples, that our brains are memory-driven systems that use our five senses and our perception of time, space, and consciousness in a way that's totally unlike the relatively simple structures of even the most complex computer chip. Readers who gobbled up Ray Kurzweil's (<i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i> and Steven Johnson's <i>Mind Wide Open</i> will find more intriguing food for thought here. Hawkins does a good job of outlining current brain research for a general audience, and his enthusiasm for brains is surprisingly contagious. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p><b>Jeff Hawkins</b> is one of the most successful and highly regarded computer architects and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.

I&#x2019;m in Teri&#x2019;s body.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour Dorsten does not know how to respond. I can&#x2019;t blame the guy since I&#x2019;m basically telling him that I have just reenacted the resurrection and risen on the third day, if it has in fact been three days since Matt shot me in the chest. I&#x2019;m not too sure of the date. The last few days have been a blur. Sometimes I felt like Teri, other times I thought I was Sita. But most of the time I felt as if I was wandering lost in a twilight realm without any clear sense of self. One thing is for sure: Even though I did technically die, I never went to heaven. I never saw Krishna, which weighs heavily on my heart.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m happy to be alive again. When I threw myself in front of the laser beam that was about to slice Seymour in half, and shouted out to Krishna, I believed deep in my soul that I would soon see my Lord. That didn&#x2019;t happen. Indeed, I don&#x2019;t know what happened. I have no memory whatsoever of what occurred immediately after I got shot.<br> <br>Nevertheless, I&#x2019;m grateful to John, Paula&#x2019;s son. It was only after the funeral ceremony, when John took my hands and gazed into my eyes, that my confusion lifted and my personality crystallized. With his help, I&#x2019;m myself again, except for the rather important fact that I&#x2019;m no longer in the body I was born with.<br> <br>Where is Teri, I wonder? How did I displace her soul? When Matt shot me, she was deep in the unconscious phase of the conversion cycle from a human being to a vampire. In order to save her life, I had already replaced a large portion of her blood with my own. Matt had been furious at my decision to change her, but he had not fired his weapon at me out of malice.<br> <br>No, he had shot me in the chest because the Array had overshadowed his will and forced him to kill me. I can only assume Cynthia Brutran had grown weary of me and activated her mind-warping tool in order to rid the world of my presence. I can&#x2019;t imagine she&#x2019;ll be happy to see me again, although I suspect she won&#x2019;t recognize me. But see me she will for I swear I&#x2019;m going to kill her the first chance I get.<br> <br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be you,&#x201d; Seymour says.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s impossible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I agree.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re confused. Changing into a vampire&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never been through it myself. But it must be a disorientating experience.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you the truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was Sita who changed you. It&#x2019;s her blood that now flows through your veins. I&#x2019;m not surprised you&#x2019;ve inherited some of her memories. That&#x2019;s what must be throwing you off. You just think you&#x2019;re Sita.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Sita.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour shakes his head firmly. &#x201c;No. Sita&#x2019;s dead. She died in my arms, in Matt&#x2019;s arms. That&#x2019;s screwed you up as well. She should have been here to teach you what it means to be a vampire. But she&#x2019;s gone and you don&#x2019;t have anyone to talk to. I mean, you can talk to me but I just write about vampires, I don&#x2019;t know shit about them. Not when it comes to the real thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I reach out and hug him. &#x201c;You know me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Teri . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up. You know it&#x2019;s me. We&#x2019;re too close, you can <i>feel</i> that I&#x2019;m here. Quit trying to convince yourself otherwise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour doesn&#x2019;t hug me back. Yet his face is suddenly stricken with grief and he is close to tears. &#x201c;No. I can&#x2019;t go there. I can&#x2019;t let myself hope. It hurts too much. Get out of here. Go back to Matt. He&#x2019;s half vampire, maybe he can tell you what to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>I continue to hold on to him. &#x201c;Matt&#x2019;s the last person I can talk to. He knows there&#x2019;s something wrong with me but he&#x2019;s nowhere close to guessing the truth. Plus he was furious that I gave Teri my blood. Now if he finds out I&#x2019;ve stolen her body, he&#x2019;ll want to kill me all over again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour does not reply. I feel him trembling in my arms. His breathing is suddenly erratic, his heart pounds. But as I stroke his head and press my lips against his neck, I feel him slowly begin to calm down. It is only then his tears start to flow, their damp saltiness washing over me like an elixir of pain. I know intuitively he has not been able to cry during the last few days. When we&#x2019;re close like this, we&#x2019;re practically one mind. I know his grief has been too intense to allow it to come to the surface. For that reason I keep touching him, soothing him, until finally his tears stop. Only then do I release him and take a step back, the heel of my right foot accidentally bumping into my coffin. It&#x2019;s weird to look at it, from the outside, and imagine what&#x2019;s on the inside.<br> <br>My dead body.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you decide to bury me?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you have me cremated?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugs as he slowly collects himself. &#x201c;I guess there was a part of me that kept hoping you would rise from the dead. Like a normal vampire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute. Was that the real reason?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t stand the thought of putting you in the fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if it&#x2019;s any consolation, I&#x2019;m glad you left me intact.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think you can get back inside your body?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seymour. I&#x2019;m a goddamn vampire. I&#x2019;m not a divine avatar. I can&#x2019;t work miracles.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe John can help. You need to talk to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;John&#x2019;s the one who just locked me tight in this body. Before he got ahold of me, I was drifting around the ozone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know exactly. I remember being up in the mountains with you and Matt, outside that cave where Teri was resting. Then I felt the Array coming and saw Matt&#x2019;s face change, like he was possessed, and I knew Brutran had caught him in her web. I&#x2019;m sure you saw the same thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did. But what happened when you jumped in front of the laser and got shot in the chest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I died. I felt myself dying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was quick. I felt my heart explode. I saw my blood pour out. But it was weird. My blood suddenly turned to gold dust, and floated up to the sky. At least that was how I saw it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw the same thing. So did Matt. What happened next?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, nothing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I mean. There was a long gap where I didn&#x2019;t experience anything. Not that I can remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is the first thing you do remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Waking up in bed beside Matt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour frowns. &#x201c;Were you naked?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you ask?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just curious.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snort. &#x201c;Here we&#x2019;re trying to solve one of the greatest mysteries of all time and all you can worry about is whether I&#x2019;ve been having sex with Matt the last few days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s none of your business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re attracted to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seymour, please, you&#x2019;ve got to help me. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on. I&#x2019;m in someone else&#x2019;s body. It&#x2019;s freaking me out. I don&#x2019;t even know if that means Teri&#x2019;s dead or not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seymour considers. &#x201c;Do you have access to all her memories?&#x201d;<br> <br>His question shocks me. Because suddenly I feel as if a computer file has opened deep in my brain&#x2014;separate from the Sita file&#x2014;and I can recall the details of Teri&#x2019;s life. The sudden flood of her nineteen years on earth staggers me and I almost fall over. Seymour reaches out and steadies me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember!&#x201d; I cry out, recalling a dozen Christmas mornings and birthdays in the Raines&#x2019; happy household. I see Teri&#x2019;s parents so clearly, they could be standing right in front of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Confusing. I feel like two people. But it&#x2019;s sort of nice, too. I feel closer to her than ever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That could be the answer. It&#x2019;s possible Teri&#x2019;s gone nowhere. Maybe you&#x2019;re overshadowing her personality. I don&#x2019;t mean this as an insult but you always were an egomaniac.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying the two of us are in this same body?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s not right. Even though I have her memories, I feel like they happened to someone else&#x2014;to her, not to me. Trust me, I would love to feel her soul inside. But she&#x2019;s gone, Seymour. She&#x2019;s just gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighs. &#x201c;Then chances are she is dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod weakly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I fear.&#x201d; The words sound so simple and plain. But a mountain of grief stands behind them. Even though I was with Teri when she was dying, I still can&#x2019;t accept her death.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to talk to John,&#x201d; Seymour says.<br> <br>&#x201c;John doesn&#x2019;t talk to people. He just hangs out and plays computer games. You remember on Santorini, he wouldn&#x2019;t even see me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True. But he came to your funeral today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He came because his mother brought him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then talk to Paula. She&#x2019;s a seer. Tell her what&#x2019;s happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What good would that do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What harm would it do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Paula warned me to stay away from Teri. She said nothing good would come from the relationship and she was right. She&#x2019;s always right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hear ya. Hey, how come you keep putting your hands over your eyes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know I was.&#x201d; I realize he&#x2019;s right and lower my hands, but I raise them a few seconds later. The glare is bothering me. It appears Teri&#x2019;s body is more sensitive to the sunlight than my own. Yet she&#x2014;or it&#x2014;is not nearly as susceptible as a newborn vampire generally is.<br> <br>I wonder how much my mind is affecting the new body I&#x2019;m in, and vice versa. Specifically, I wonder if I&#x2019;m as strong as I used to be. Going by the way I walk and talk, and the acuity of my senses, I don&#x2019;t feel nearly as powerful as I normally do.<br> <br>That worries me. I&#x2019;ll have to be at full strength to deal with Brutran and the IIC, never mind the Telar. However, there might be some advantage in their thinking I&#x2019;m dead. I tell Seymour as much but he is doubtful.<br> <br>&#x201c;The only way we can deal with those two groups is to hide from them,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That battle we had with the Telar three days ago proved that. You and Matt hit them with everything you had in your arsenal and they kept coming. Their organization is too big, too deeply entrenched in too many countries. The same with Brutran and the IIC. There&#x2019;s no way we can fight them. At least not directly.&#x201d;<br> <br>I point to the blisters he has on the back of his right hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you forgetting about the X6X6 virus the Telar are planning to release? If we sit back and do nothing, seven billion people will die.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean we should find a cave in the Rockies and hibernate. We still have a vial of the T-11 vaccine and we have Charlie on our side. We need to put him in touch with other scientists who can help him reproduce the vaccine on a massive scale.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that vaccine even working?&#x201d; I study his blisters more closely. They&#x2019;re dark and look plump with dead blood. &#x201c;Have you given yourself another shot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yesterday. It slowed down the spread of the blisters but it didn&#x2019;t get rid of them. Shanti has blisters as well, on her face, especially on the skin that she had grafted on. I was planning to give her another dose today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you talked to Charlie about what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a chance. It took all my time to plan your funeral.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose I should be grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mention it. But I&#x2019;m serious when I say we have to keep a low profile when it comes to the Telar and IIC. We can&#x2019;t fight ten thousand immortals and we can&#x2019;t fight Brutran&#x2019;s Array.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wonder how Brutran was able to lock the Array on Matt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why should he be immune?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;First off he&#x2019;s a Telar/vampire hybrid, and his father, Yaksha, was not just any vampire. Matt&#x2019;s stronger and faster than I am. Also, we assumed Brutran was able to attack because she collected blood from me at her Malibu office. But I can&#x2019;t see how she could have gotten ahold of a sample of Matt&#x2019;s blood.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The relationship between your blood and the Array is just a theory of yours. It might be wrong. We&#x2019;re still not sure what the Array is or how it works. Brutran might be able to target whoever she wants.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Brutran went to a lot of trouble to get a sample of my blood. Then she went out of her way to avoid me until my blood had been disbursed to her people. That I&#x2019;m sure of.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Matt could have run into her people in the past, without knowing it. Ask him when you&#x2019;re in bed tonight. He might remember something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t ask him that. It&#x2019;s not a question Teri would ask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re going to keep Matt in the dark? How long do you think that will last? You have to tell him the truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid. He has a temper. I told you, he was furious at me for trying to change Teri into a vampire, even if it was to save her life. Right now, he&#x2019;s probably just learning to accept her as a vampire. Now, if I tell him that not only did the change not work, but I just happened to steal Teri&#x2019;s body in the process, he&#x2019;ll explode. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if he tried to kill me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to kill his old girlfriend&#x2019;s body.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He might if he&#x2019;s convinced she&#x2019;s not coming back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t choose for this to happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t care! He&#x2019;s not going to react logically. He&#x2019;s emotionally on fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand all that. But he needs you and you need him. You two are the only ones who can save the world from these maniacs. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be now, but at some point you&#x2019;re going to have to risk telling him the truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Agreed. Later. A lot later. Let&#x2019;s give it a few days. Or weeks.&#x201d; I stare down at my coffin. &#x201c;I need to be alone for a few minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>He hesitates. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; He turns and walks toward his car. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do anything disgusting,&#x201d; he calls over his shoulder.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;s gone, I kneel beside the coffin and put my hands on the top. I&#x2019;m sitting in the same position John was when he did whatever it was he did to my body. Or should I say my old body? Chances are this change is permanent.<br> <br>The coffin has been nailed shut. Even though I lack my old strength, I&#x2019;m still a vampire with Sita&#x2019;s blood flowing through my veins. That makes me stronger than a dozen men combined. I snap the top off without effort and set it aside. For the first time in my long life, I stare at myself from the outside. The effect is overwhelming. I shake, feel a wave of dizziness, and for a moment I fear I will faint.<br> <br>I look so much like me, and yet I&#x2019;m a stranger to myself. It frightens me to gaze at my face. I could be staring at a mirror that lies under a foot of water. I look like a ghost.<br> <br>I have a hole in my chest, in my heart. The long white dress the morgue has dressed me in does not hide the fact. There is a dark red and gold stain where the material brushes the skin near my left breast. I know I should not touch the wound but feel I must. My shaking hand reaches out and pops two buttons off the dress as my fingers probe the rim of the wound that ended five thousand years of life.<br> <br>The hole feels narrow, too narrow. Of course I have no clear idea how wide it should be, yet it doesn&#x2019;t seem right. Plus my dress is stained because the wound is still damp, when it should be dry.<br> <br>I smell not a hint of formaldehyde. I know Seymour would not have allowed me to be embalmed, on the off chance someone might have tried to steal my blood.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s just something about the wound that&#x2019;s unnatural.<br> <br>I get the impression it&#x2019;s slowly healing.<br> <br>Yet the dead do not heal.<br> <br>Not even dead vampires.<br> <br>On impulse, I let go of the bloody hole and reach up with my other hand and open my eyes. Leaning forward on my knees, I stare down into them, and here I note a definite change. They are darker than before. The blue is closer to black, and they gaze back at me with a reflectivity that no mirror could match. However, I don&#x2019;t see myself in them...</p><h2>One Foot in Eden: A Novel</h2><p>Will Alexander is the sheriff in a small town in southern Appalachia, and he knows that the local thug Holland Winchester has been murdered. The only thing is the sheriff can find neither the body nor someone to attest to the killing. Simply, almost elementally told through the voices of the sheriff, a local farmer, his beautiful wife, their son, and the sheriff's deputy,<i> One Foot in Eden</i> signals the bellwether arrival of Ron Rash, one the most mature and distinctive voices in Southern literature.</p><p><b>Ron Rash</b> is the author of the prize-winning novels <i>One Foot in Eden, Saints</i> <i>at the River </i>and <i>The World Made Straight</i>, as well as several collections of poetry and short stories.

Desirous of being a nun, she instead obeyed her parents and married. Her husband was cruel, and caused her much suffering, to which she responded with love and prayers and eventually converted him. After the death of her husband and two sons, Rita was able to enter a convent, where she devoted herself to prayer and penance. She abandoned herself totally to God, diminishing herself as He increased in her. An inspiring story of a soul completely resigned to God\&#39;s will. 132 pgs, PB</p><p>The Rev.

When an expert in the law asked Jesus what the greatest commandment is, Jesus gave a clear and simple answer: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these." But what does the Great Commandment look like on the ground, in our day-to-day lives? And can we even come close to living it out? Jesus, Greg Ogden believes, has a simple answer to that too. He writes, "Jesus didn't follow [the Great Commandment] up by saying, 'I know I'm asking a lot, but do the best you can. I know you'll never fully approximate this high and lofty goal, but it's still worth striving for.' . . . Jesus thinks this is possible." And with Jesus, Ogden has found, it <em>is</em> possible--and essential. In this practical, in-depth handbook, Ogden draws from his years of pastoral experience training and discipling others to help us truly be changed by Christ into people who love God and love others with all that we are. Following the format of his bestselling <em>Discipleship Essentials,</em> each chapter includes <ul><li>a core truth</li><li>a memory verse</li><li>an inductive Bible study</li><li>a reading on one aspect of the Great Commandment</li></ul> Thoughtful questions will also help you examine your heart and life and move you to open yourself to God's transforming work. Above all, Ogden helps you see that the Great Commandment is actually a great invitation to join God in bringing his kingdom to earth. And as you learn to do so, you'll find that the greatest commandment leads to the greatest life possible.</p><p><strong>Greg Ogden</strong> (D.Min., Fuller Theological Seminary) is executive pastor of discipleship at Christ Church of Oak Brook in Oak Brook, Illinois. Previously he was academic director of the doctor of ministry program and associate professor of lay equipping and discipleship at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. Prior to that he was a pastor for twenty-three years with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). He is the author of <em>Discipleship Essentials</em> and coauthor with Daniel Meyer of <em>Leadership Essentials.</em>"<em>The Essential Commandment</em> could be a great resource for the development of a church mission. I foresee immense usefulness in the encouragement of outreach to communities with which all churches are surrounded." (Lyn Housen, Insights, November 2012)<br><br>"In <em>The Essential Commandment,</em> Greg Ogden has once again taken the complex subject of Christian discipleship and made it truly understandable and personally applicable. After reading this book, you will wonder why more authors have not made the Great Commandment of Jesus their central focus. More importantly, you will be grateful that Ogden has, and that he's given you another essential tool for finding your way and helping others into the deeper life of Christ." (Daniel Meyer, senior pastor of Christ Church of Oak Brook and author of Witness Essentials)</p><h2>History: Why It Matters</h2><p><p>We justify our actions in the present through our understanding of the past. But we live in a time when politicians lie brazenly about historical facts and meddle with the content of history books, while media differ wildly in their reporting of the same event. Frequently, new discoveries force us to re-evaluate everything we thought we knew about the past.<br><br>So how can any certainty about history be established, and why does it matter? Lynn Hunt shows why the search for truth about the past, as a continual process of discovery, is vital for our societies. History has an essential role to play in ensuring honest presentation of evidence. In this way, it can foster humility about our present-day concerns, a critical attitude toward chauvinism, and an openness to other peoples and cultures. History, Hunt argues, is our best defense against tyranny.<br><br>Introducing Polity&#x2019;s <i>Why It Matters</i> series; in these short and lively books, world-leading thinkers make the case for the importance of their subjects and aim to inspire a new generation of students.</p></p><p><b>Lynn Hunt</b>&nbsp;is a world-renowned historian of Europe who has written numerous scholarly and popular history books.

But concerned parents are pleading for answers to their many questions. Doctors only tell them one side of the story; there is another side.

No one provided him with convincing evidence so he researched the scientific literature on his own and wrote a vaccine book that went on to become a bestseller (more than 150,000 copies sold). Today, this profound and compelling immunization handbook, "Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?," has been completely updated and revised (2008). It contains 30 graphs and more than 900 references. This essential immunization resource is the best introductory vaccine book in the world! (The author's new, 560 page Vaccine Safety Manual, has replaced it as the world's most complete guide to immunization risks and protection.) <p>"Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?" includes the latest information on ALL recommended childhood shots plus smallpox, shingles, HPV and flu. In addition, this remarkable vaccine guide...Evaluates each vaccine for safety, efficacy, and long-term effects; Includes the most recent studies and provides numerous case histories; Pinpoints for parents exact conditions that may put their own child at high risk; Documents correlations between vaccines and several new diseases; Outlines current vaccine laws and offers parental options to "mandatory" shots; Helps all concerned people to make wise and responsible decisions. </p><p>When New Atlantean Press first published "Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?" some people opposed our efforts to educate parents and health practitioners. Of course, many others were deeply grateful. Today, this book has been translated into several languages. In addition, chiropractic colleges stock it in their bookstores and midwives recommend it to their clients. Many pediatricians and other doctors purchase this book as well. Often, they are surprised by the number of valid studies documenting vaccine hazards. This information was not taught in medical school. </p><p>This book will continue to arouse strong emotions. It is well written and well documented. Furthermore, this latest edition of "Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?" is much more extensive than the earlier edition. For example, the previous book had 300 notes and references; this new book has more than 900 notes and references -- a threefold increase in researched data! The previous book had 12 illustrations; this new book has 30 charts and graphs. The previous book was just 78 pages; this new book has 128 pages -- nearly twice as much new information! </p><p>This latest edition also answers many more questions than the earlier edition. For example, how are the vaccines made? Do they still contain thimerosal, a mercury derivative? Are the chickenpox and MMR vaccines manufactured in human fetal tissue? Do credible studies show correlations between the current autism epidemic and vaccines? These questions and many, many more are answered in this book.</p>I wrote "Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?" so that parents and health practitioners could make more informed decisions regarding vaccines. I do not advocate them, nor do I presume to know what is best for other families. I merely try to present the facts in a clear and straightforward manner. <p>After reading my book, parents often contact me to express their gratitude. They appreciate the simple format complemented by extensive research. Every statement in my book is referenced to a valid scientific study or other reputable source of data. Information that would have otherwise remained hidden is revealed so that you can make informed decisions. </p><p>Some critics argue that I don't believe vaccines reduced the incidence of disease. My "beliefs" are irrelevant. In some cases, no credible evidence supports the contention that a particular vaccine is essentially responsible for a reduction in that disease. In other cases, convincing arguments can be made for and against this basic claim. More importantly, several vaccines have been linked to new diseases. I thoroughly document these correlations. Thus, even if a vaccine is instrumental in reducing case numbers of a single disease, what overall benefit have we gained if it simultaneously causes two or three new ailments?

Arms patiently crossed, waiting, waiting and wondering who I&#x2019;m in, what I&#x2019;m in for. My eyes close nostalgically when I remember how I once drifted in my translucent body bag, floated dreamily in the bubble of my thoughts through my private ocean in slow-motion somersaults, colliding gently against the trans�parent bounds of my confinement, the confiding membrane that vibrated with, even as it muffled, the voices of con�spirators in a vile enterprise. That was in my careless youth. Now, fully inverted, not an inch of space to myself, knees crammed against belly, my thoughts as well as my head are fully engaged. I&#x2019;ve no choice, my ear is pressed all day and night against the bloody walls. I listen, make mental notes, and I&#x2019;m troubled. I&#x2019;m hearing pillow talk of deadly intent and I&#x2019;m terrified by what awaits me, by what might draw me in.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m immersed in abstractions, and only the proliferating relations between them create the illusion of a known world. When I hear &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; which I&#x2019;ve never seen, I imagine some kind of mental event that&#x2019;s fairly close to &#x201c;green&#x201d;&#x2014;which I&#x2019;ve never seen. I count myself an innocent, unburdened by allegiances and obligations, a free spirit, despite my meagre living room. No one to contradict or reprimand me, no name or previous address, no religion, no debts, no enemies. My appointment diary, if it existed, notes only my forthcoming birthday. I am, or I was, despite what the geneticists are now saying, a blank slate. But a slippery, porous slate no school�room or cottage roof could find use for, a slate that writes upon itself as it grows by the day and becomes less blank. I count myself an innocent, but it seems I&#x2019;m party to a plot. My mother, bless her unceasing, loudly squelching heart, seems to be involved. <br> &nbsp;<br> Seems, Mother? No, it <i>is</i>. You are. You are involved. I&#x2019;ve known from my beginning. Let me summon it, that moment of creation that arrived with my first concept. Long ago, many weeks ago, my neural groove closed upon itself to become my spine and my many million young neurons, busy as silkworms, spun and wove from their trailing axons the gorgeous golden fabric of my first idea, a notion so simple it partly eludes me now. Was it <i>me</i>? Too self-loving. Was it <i>now</i>? Overly dramatic. Then something antecedent to both, containing both, a single word mediated by a mental sigh or swoon of acceptance, of pure being, something like&#x2014;<i>this</i>? <br> &nbsp;<br> Too precious. So, getting closer, my idea was <i>To be</i>. Or if not that, its grammatical variant, <i>is</i>. This was my aboriginal notion and here&#x2019;s the crux&#x2014;<i>is</i>. Just that. In the spirit of <i>Es muss sein</i>. The beginning of conscious life was the end of illusion, the illusion of non-being, and the eruption of the real. The triumph of realism over magic, of <i>is </i>over <i>seems</i>. My mother <i>is </i>involved in a plot, and therefore I am too, even if my role might be to foil it. Or if I, reluctant fool, come to term too late, then to avenge it. <br> &nbsp;<br> But I don&#x2019;t whine in the face of good fortune. I knew from the start, when I unwrapped from its cloth of gold my gift of consciousness, that I could have arrived in a worse place in a far worse time. The generalities are already clear, against which my domestic troubles are, or should be, negligible. There&#x2019;s much to celebrate. I&#x2019;ll inherit a condition of moder�nity (hygiene, holidays, anaesthetics, reading lamps, oranges in winter) and inhabit a privileged corner of the planet&#x2014;well-fed, plague-free western Europe. Ancient Europa, scle�rotic, relatively kind, tormented by its ghosts, vulnerable to bullies, unsure of herself, destination of choice for unfor�tunate millions. My immediate neighbourhood will not be palmy Norway&#x2014;my first choice on account of its gigantic sovereign fund and generous social provision; nor my second, Italy, on grounds of regional cuisine and sun-blessed decay; and not even my third, France, for its Pinot Noir and jaunty self-regard. Instead I&#x2019;ll inherit a less than united kingdom ruled by an esteemed elderly queen, where a businessman-prince, famed for his good works, his elixirs (cauliflower essence to purify the blood) and unconstitutional meddling, waits restively for his crown. This will be my home, and it will do. I might have emerged in North Korea, where succes�sion is also uncontested but freedom and food are wanting. <br> &nbsp;<br> How is it that I, not even young, not even born yesterday, could know so much, or know enough to be wrong about so much? I have my sources, I <i>listen</i>. My mother, Trudy, when she isn&#x2019;t with her friend Claude, likes the radio and pre�fers talk to music. Who, at the Internet&#x2019;s inception, would have foreseen the rise and rise of radio, or the renaissance of that archaic word, &#x201c;wireless&#x201d;? I hear, above the launder�ette din of stomach and bowels, the news, wellspring of all bad dreams. Driven by a self-harming compulsion, I listen closely to analysis and dissent. Repeats on the hour, regu�lar half-hourly summaries don&#x2019;t bore me. I even tolerate the BBC World Service and its puerile blasts of synthetic trum�pets and xylophone to separate the items. In the middle of a long, quiet night I might give my mother a sharp kick. She&#x2019;ll wake, become insomniac, reach for the radio. Cruel sport, I know, but we are both better informed by the morning. <br> &nbsp;<br> And she likes podcast lectures, and self-improving audio books&#x2014;<i>Know Your Wine </i>in fifteen parts, biographies of seventeenth-century playwrights, and various world classics. James Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Ulysses </i>sends her to sleep, even as it thrills me. <br> &nbsp;<br> When, in the early days, she inserted her earbuds, I heard clearly, so efficiently did sound waves travel through jawbone and clavicle, down through her skeletal structure, swiftly through the nourishing amniotic. Even television conveys most of its meagre utility by sound. Also, when my mother and Claude meet, they occasionally discuss the state of the world, usually in terms of lament, even as they scheme to make it worse. Lodged where I am, nothing to do but grow my body and mind, I take in everything, even the trivia&#x2014;of which there is much. <br> &nbsp;<br> For Claude is a man who prefers to repeat himself. A man of riffs. On shaking hands with a stranger&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve heard this twice&#x2014;he&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;Claude, as in Debussy.&#x201d; How wrong he is. This is Claude as in property developer who composes nothing, invents nothing. He enjoys a thought, speaks it aloud, then later has it again, and&#x2014;why not?&#x2014;says it again. Vibrating the air a second time with this thought is integral to his pleasure. He knows you know he&#x2019;s repeating himself. What he can&#x2019;t know is that you don&#x2019;t enjoy it the way he does. This, I&#x2019;ve learned from a Reith lecture, is what is known as a problem of reference. <br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s an example both of Claude&#x2019;s discourse and of how I gather information. He and my mother have arranged by telephone (I hear both sides) to meet in the evening. Dis�counting me, as they tend to&#x2014;a candlelit dinner for two. How do I know about the lighting? Because when the hour comes and they are shown to their seats I hear my mother complain. The candles are lit at every table but ours. <br> &nbsp;<br> There follows in sequence Claude&#x2019;s irritated gasp, an imperious snapping of dry fingers, the kind of obsequious murmur that emanates, so I would guess, from a waiter bent at the waist, the rasp of a lighter. It&#x2019;s theirs, a candlelit dinner. All they lack is the food. But they have the weighty menus on their laps&#x2014;I feel the bottom edge of Trudy&#x2019;s across the small of my back. Now I must listen again to Claude&#x2019;s set piece on menu terms, as if he&#x2019;s the first ever to spot these unimportant absurdities. He lingers on &#x201c;pan-fried.&#x201d; What is <i>pan </i>but a deceitful benediction on the vulgar and unhealthy <i>fried</i>? Where else might one fry his scallops with chilli and lime juice? In an egg timer? Before moving on, he repeats some of this with a variation of emphasis. Then, his second favourite, an American import, &#x201c;steel-cut.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m silently mouthing his exposition even before he&#x2019;s begun when a slight tilt in my vertical orientation tells me that my mother is leaning forwards to place a restraining finger on his wrist and say, sweetly, divertingly, &#x201c;Choose the wine, darling. Something splendid.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> I like to share a glass with my mother. You may never have experienced, or you will have forgotten, a good bur�gundy (her favourite) or a good Sancerre (also her favourite) decanted through a healthy placenta. Even before the wine arrives&#x2014;tonight, a Jean-Max Roger Sancerre&#x2014;at the sound of a drawn cork, I feel it on my face like the caress of a sum�mer breeze. I know that alcohol will lower my intelligence. It lowers everybody&#x2019;s intelligence. But oh, a joyous, blushful Pinot Noir, or a gooseberried Sauvignon, sets me turning and tumbling across my secret sea, reeling off the walls of my castle, the bouncy castle that is my home. Or so it did when I had more space. Now I take my pleasures sedately, and by the second glass my speculations bloom with that licence whose name is poetry. My thoughts unspool in well-sprung pen�tameters, end-stopped and run-on lines in pleasing variation. But she never takes a third, and it wounds me. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have to think of baby,&#x201d; I hear her say as she covers her glass with a priggish hand. That&#x2019;s when I have it in mind to reach for my oily cord, as one might a velvet rope in a well-staffed country house, and pull sharply for service. What ho! Another round here for us friends! <br> &nbsp;<br> But no, she restrains herself for love of me. And I love her&#x2014;how could I not? The mother I have yet to meet, whom I know only from the inside. Not enough! I long for her exter�nal self. Surfaces are everything. I know her hair is &#x201c;straw fair,&#x201d; that it tumbles in &#x201c;coins of wild curls&#x201d; to her &#x201c;shoulders the white of apple flesh,&#x201d; because my father has read aloud to her his poem about it in my presence. Claude too has referred to her hair, in less inventive terms. When she&#x2019;s in the mood, she&#x2019;ll make tight braids to wind around her head, in the style, my father says, of Yulia Tymoshenko. I also know that my mother&#x2019;s eyes are green, that her nose is a &#x201c;pearly button,&#x201d; that she wishes she had more of one, that separately both men adore it as it is and have tried to reassure her. She&#x2019;s been told many times that she&#x2019;s beautiful, but she remains scepti�cal, which confers on her an innocent power over men, so my father told her one afternoon in the library. She replied that if this was true, it was a power she&#x2019;d never looked for and didn&#x2019;t want. This was an unusual conversation for them and I listened intently. My father, whose name is John, said that if he had such a power over her or women in general, he couldn&#x2019;t imagine giving it up. I guessed, from the sympa�thetic wave motion which briefly lifted my ear from the wall, that my mother had emphatically shrugged, as if to say, So men are different. Who cares? Besides, she told him out loud, whatever power she was supposed to have was only what men conferred in their fantasies. Then the phone rang, my father walked away to take the call, and this rare and interesting conversation about those that have power was never resumed. <br> &nbsp;<br> But back to my mother, my untrue Trudy, whose apple-flesh arms and breasts and green regard I long for, whose inexplicable need for Claude pre-dates my first awareness, my primal <i>is</i>, and who often speaks to him, and he to her, in pillow whispers, restaurant whispers, kitchen whispers, as if both suspect that wombs have ears. <br> &nbsp;<br> I used to think that their discretion was no more than ordinary, amorous intimacy. But now I&#x2019;m certain. They airily bypass their vocal cords because they&#x2019;re planning a dreadful event. Should it go wrong, I&#x2019;ve heard them say, their lives will be ruined. They believe that if they&#x2019;re to proceed, they should act quickly, and soon. They tell each other to be calm and patient, remind each other of the cost of their plan&#x2019;s miscarriage, that there are several stages, that each must interlock, that if any single one fails, then all must fail &#x201c;like old-fashioned Christmas tree lights&#x201d;&#x2014;this impenetrable simile from Claude, who rarely says anything obscure. What they intend sickens and frightens them, and they can never speak of it directly. Instead, wrapped in whispers are ellipses, euphemisms, mumbled aporia followed by throat-clearing and a brisk change of subject. <br> &nbsp;<br> One hot, restless night last week, when I thought both were long asleep, my mother said suddenly into the darkness, two hours before dawn by the clock downstairs in my father&#x2019;s study, &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> And straight away Claude said flatly, &#x201c;We can.&#x201d; And then, after a moment&#x2019;s reflection, &#x201c;We <i>can</i>.&#x201d;</p><h2>Gods and Myths of Northern Europe</h2><p>Surveys the pre-Christian beliefs of the Scandinavian and Germanic peoples.

This creative little girl always strives to think outside the box, so when she spots a small china bird that she desperately wants, she forms an imaginative plan for getting it&#x2014;and her methods are anything but ordinary!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Violet Mackerel&#x2019;s Brilliant Plot</i> is the first book in an irresistibly charming series starring Violet and her family that has pitch-perfect perspective and plenty of laugh-out-loud humor.</p><p>Anna Branford was born on the Isle of Man and spent parts of her childhood in Africa and in Papua New Guinea. Now she lives in Melbourne, Australia, with a large black cat called Florence. She writes, drinks cups of tea in her garden, and makes dolls and other small things, which she sells at early morning markets.<b> </b>Anna is the author of the Violet Mackerel series.

Stop by and say hi at ElannaAllen.com.<b></b><br> <br>Violet Mackerel is quite a small girl, but she has a theory.<br> <br>Her theory is that when you are having a very important and brilliant idea, what generally happens is that you find something small and special on the ground. So whenever you spy a sequin, or a stray bead, or a bit of ribbon, or a button, you should always pick it up and try very hard to remember what you were thinking about at the precise moment when you spied it, and then think about that thing a lot more. That is Violet&#x2019;s theory, which she calls the Theory of Finding Small Things.<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, Violet,&#x201d; says Violet&#x2019;s mama. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nearly five o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br> <br>It is Saturday, which is market day. Violet yawns. It is still dark. Mama&#x2019;s hair is a bit damp from her shower and it smells like mangoes and blossoms. Violet leans forward for a snuggle and nearly falls asleep again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just stay awake until we&#x2019;re all in the van,&#x201d; says Mama. &#x201c;Then you can sleep as much as you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>Violet&#x2019;s big brother, Dylan, and big sister, Nicola, are already awake, and they are helping to load up the van with fold-up tables and chairs, the big canopy umbrella, and boxes and baskets of Mama&#x2019;s knitting. They are going to the market like they do every Saturday morning, to sell the woolly things Mama makes.<br> <br>Violet thinks she would quite like to wear her pajama bottoms under her skirt today. They feel nice and warm from bed. Sometimes if you say things like &#x201c;Can I wear my pajama bottoms to the market?,&#x201d; people say things like &#x201c;No.&#x201d; But if you just put your skirt on over the top, and have your eyebrows slightly raised like someone who is thinking of something very important and interesting, no one says anything at all.<br><br>When Violet, Mama, Nicola, and Dylan arrive at the market, even though it is still not properly light, lots of people are already there, bundled up and rubbing their hands together with coldness, unfolding and unpacking their things to sell. No one notices Violet&#x2019;s pajama bottoms.<br> <br>Violet&#x2019;s favorite person at the market (apart from Mama and Dylan and Nicola and herself) is a man who never smiles. He sells china birds, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and he is there every week. Violet says hello to him as she always does, and he doesn&#x2019;t even look up, which he never does. But after waking up at nearly five o&#x2019;clock in the morning, Violet doesn&#x2019;t feel much like chatting or smiling either. So she feels that even though he never says hello back, she and the man might share a sort of <i>understanding</i>.<br> <br>The man&#x2019;s china birds are all different and all very dirty. Dylan says that they are probably brand-new from a factory. He thinks the man has just put dirt on them so that they will look ancient and he can sell them for ten dollars instead of two. But Violet doubts it. She thinks it is much more likely that he is an archaeologist. She suspects that he specializes in digging up ancient china birds.<br><br>Violet would quite like to own one of the man&#x2019;s birds in particular. It is made of pale blue china, the color of a robin&#x2019;s egg. It is always right at the back of the table.<br> <br>And just as she is having that thought, out of the corner of her eye, Violet spies a small red button on the dusty market ground.</p><h2>Night Vision (A Doc Ford Novel)</h2><p><b>Doc Ford is on a collision course with death in this extraordinary&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller from Randy Wayne White. <br><br></b>The Red Citrus trailer park is inhabited mostly by illegal laborers. But the steroid-powered park manager and his grotesquely muscular girlfriend figure that selling the park to developers would be easy money&#x2014;and they're ready to do whatever it takes to drive the residents out. <br> &nbsp;<br> The problem is a young girl who the laborers believe talks to God. The manager doesn&#x2019;t know if she's valuable or a liability. But when the girl witnesses him dumping a corpse into a lake, there is one thing he knows for certain: He's got to shut her up permanently.<br><br>The girl's only hope for survival: marine biologist Doc Ford, who must search through an underground, invisible nation...and hope he reaches her in time.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b>&nbsp;is the author of the Doc Ford novels, the Hannah Smith novels, and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years, and spends much of his free time windsurfing, playing baseball, and hanging out at Doc Ford's Rum Bar &amp; Grille.Trouble is brewing at a Florida trailer park populated by illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America: the park&#x2019;s manager, a steroid freak who dabbles in snuff movies, draws his expendable talent from the immigrant population, but he&#x2019;s managed to offend a drug lord, who isn&#x2019;t pleased that his female customers are turning up dead. Matters are further complicated when an adolescent girl, Tula, rumored to possess mystical ability, sees the manager feeding a body to his pet gator. Doc Ford, Sanibel Island marine biologist and sometime black-ops agent, is drawn into the trailer-park trauma by his longtime friend Tomlinson, the aging hippie whose own mystical inclinations have brought him into contact with Tula. When the steroid freak kidnaps Tula, Ford is forced to go full commando&#x2014;night-vision goggles and all&#x2014;to track down the girl and dispatch the numerous bad guys. As always, White handles the action scenes superbly, writing with both precision and dramatic flair, but he gets inside the heads of his characters, too, not only Ford, the conflicted warrior, but also Tula, who sees herself as Joan of Arc, and even the steroid freak, who just may have an inner life beneath his biceps. A must for series fans. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: It took White&#x2019;s Doc Ford series a while to draw a mainstream audience, but the books started turning up on New York Times best-seller lists several years ago and are likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. A three-week author tour will give the charismatic White, a former fishing guide and veteran real-life adventurer, plenty of opportunity to spread the word still further. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Guitar Electronics Understanding Wiring and Diagrams: Learn step by step how to completely wire your electric guitar</h2><p>THIS IS THE ONLY WIRING GUIDE YOU WILL EVER NEED TO BUY.

Women like Bertha Ragan Tickey, who set strikeout records and taught Lana Turner to pitch, and her teammate Joan Joyce, who struck out baseball star Ted Williams, made a name&#x2014;and a life&#x2014;for themselves in an era when female athletes had almost no prospects.

Gandhi, called Mahatma (&#x201c;great soul&#x201d;), was the father of modern India, but his influence has spread well beyond the subcontinent and is as important today as it was in the first part of the twentieth century and during this nation&#x2019;s own civil rights movement.

Born in 1869 in British India, he was the pioneer of Satyagraha&#x2014;a philosophy that is concerned with truth and resistance to evil through active, non-violent resistance. He led India to independence from Britain and inspired movements for freedom and civil rights around the world. Gandhi lived a simple life, organizing an ashram that was self sufficient and even made his own clothes. He lived on a vegetarian diet and later on a fruitarian diet. He often underwent long fasts, for both self purification and for protest.He was assassinated in 1948 in New Delhi, India.part one<br><br>the man<br><br>[ 1 ]<br><br>beginnings of a great man<br><br>[To the end of his days, Gandhi attempted to master and remake himself. He called his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth, an "experiment" being an operation within and upon oneself. The following excerpts are taken from the book.]<br><br>. . . [It] is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiography. I simply want to tell the story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape of an autobiography. But I shall not mind if every page of it speaks only of my experiments. I believe, or at any rate flatter myself with the belief, that a connected account of all these experiments will not be without benefit to the reader. My experiments in the political field are now known, not only in India but to a certain extent to the "civilized" world. For me, they have not much value and the title of Mahatma [Great Soul] that they have won for me, has, therefore, even less. Often the title has deeply pained me and there is not a moment I can recall when it may be said to have tickled me. But I should certainly like to narrate my experiments in the spiritual field which are known only to myself and from which I have derived such power as I possess for working in the political field. If the experiments are really spiritual, then there can be no room for self-praise. They can only add to my humility. The more I reflect and look back on the past, the more vividly do I feel my limitations.<br><br>What I want to achieve--what I have been striving and pining to achieve these thirty years--is self-realization, to see God face to face, to attain Moksha [Salvation--oneness with God and freedom from later incarnations]. I live and move and have my being in pursuit of this goal. All that I do by way of speaking and writing, and all my ventures in the political field are directed to this same end. . . .1<br><br>To see the universal and all-pervading Spirit of Truth face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself. And a man who aspires after that cannot afford to keep out of any field of life. That is why my devotion to Truth has drawn me into the field of politics and I can say without the slightest hesitation and yet in all humility, that those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means.2<br><br>. . . In the march towards Truth, anger, selfishness, hatred, etc., naturally give way, for otherwise Truth would be impossible to attain. . . . A successful search for Truth means complete deliverance from the dual throng, such as of love and hate, happiness and misery. . . .3<br><br>[As] I have all along believed that what is possible for one is possible for all, my experiments have not been conducted in the closet but in the open. . . .4<br><br>The Gandhis belong to the Bania [Businessman] caste and seem to have been originally grocers. ["Gandhi" means grocer.] But for three generations, from my grandfather, they have been Prime Ministers in several Kathiawad [Western India] States. Uttamchand Gandhi, alias Ota Gandhi, my grandfather, must have been a man of principle. State intrigues compelled him to leave Porbandar, where he was Diwan [Prime Minister] and to seek refuge in Junagadh [the nearby little state]. There he saluted the Nawab [Ruler] with his left hand. Someone noticing the apparent discourtesy asked for an explanation, which was thus given: "The right hand is already pledged to Porbandar."<br><br>Ota Gandhi married a second time, having lost his first wife. He had four sons by his first wife and two by his second wife. I do not think that in my childhood I ever felt or knew that these sons . . . were not all of the same mother. The fifth of these six brothers was Karamchand Gandhi, alias Kaba Gandhi, and the sixth was Tulsidas Gandhi. Both these brothers were Prime Ministers in Porbandar, one after the other. Kaba Gandhi was my father. He was a member of the Rajasthanik Court. It is now extinct but in those days it was a very influential body for settling disputes between the chiefs and their fellow clansmen. He was for some time Prime Minister in Rajkot and then in Vankaner. He was a pensioner of the Rajkot State when he died.<br><br>Kaba Gandhi married four times in succession, having lost his wife each time by death. He had two daughters by his first and second marriages. His last wife, Putlibai, bore him a daughter and three sons, I being the youngest.<br><br>My father was a lover of his clan, truthful, brave and generous but short-tempered. To a certain extent he might have been given even to carnal pleasures. For he married for the fourth time when he was over forty. But he was incorruptible and had earned a name for strict impartiality in his family as well as outside. His loyalty to the state was well-known. [A British] Assistant Political Agent [once] spoke insultingly of the Rajkot Thakore Saheb, his chief, and he stood up to the insult. The agent was angry and asked Kaba Gandhi to apologize. This he refused to do and was therefore kept under detention for a few hours. But when the Agent saw that Kaba Gandhi was adamant he ordered him to be released.<br><br>My father never had any ambition to accumulate riches and left us very little property.<br><br>The outstanding impression my mother has left on my memory is that of saintliness. She was deeply religious. She would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers. Going to Haveli--the Vaishnava [Orthodox Hindu] temple--was one of her daily duties. As far as my memory can go back I do not remember her having ever missed the Chaturmas [a fasting period similar to Lent]. She would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. Illness was no excuse for relaxing them. . . . To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. Living on one meal a day during Chaturmas was a habit with her. Not content with that she fasted every alternate day during one Chaturmas. During another Chaturmas she vowed not to have food without seeing the sun. We children on those days would stand, staring at the sky, waiting to announce the appearance of the sun to our mother. Everyone knows that at the height of the rainy season the sun often does not condescend to show his face. And I remember days when, at his sudden appearance, we would rush and announce it to her. She would run out to see with her own eyes, but by that time the fugitive sun would be gone, thus depriving her of her meal. "That does not matter," she would say cheerfully, "God did not want me to eat today." And she would return to her round of duties.<br><br>Of these parents I was born at Porbandar, otherwise known as Sudamapuri, on the second October, 1869. I passed my childhood in Porbandar. I recollect having been put to school. It was with some difficulty that I got through the multiplication tables. The fact that I recollect nothing more of those days than having learnt, in company with other boys, to call our teacher all kinds of names would strongly suggest that my intellect must have been sluggish and my memory raw.5<br><br>I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar for Rajkot to become a member of the Rajasthanik Court. There I was put into a primary school . . . I could have been only a mediocre student. From this school I went to the suburban school and thence to the high school, having already reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever told a lie during this short period either to my teachers or to my schoolmates. I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My books and my lessons were my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and to run back home as soon as the school closed--that was my daily habit. I literally ran back because I could not bear to talk to anybody. I was afraid even lest anyone should poke fun at me.<br><br>[When he grew older, however, he found some congenial mates and played in the streets. He also played by the sea.]<br><br>[An] incident which occurred at the examination during my first year at the high school . . . is worth recording. Mr. Giles, the [British] Education Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to write as a spelling exercise. One of the words was "kettle." I had misspelt it. The teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his boot but I would not be prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my neighbor's slate for I had thought the teacher was there to supervise us against copying. The result was that all the boys except myself were found to have spelt every word correctly. Only I had been stupid. The teacher tried later to bring this stupidity home to me but without effect. I never could learn the art of "copying."<br><br>Yet the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my teacher. I was by nature blind to the faults of elders. Later I came to know many other failings of this teacher but my regard for him remained the same. For I had learnt to carry out the orders of elders, not to scan their actions.6<br><br>[But compliance at school did not preclude revolt outside it.]<br><br>A [young] relative and I became fond of smoking . . . we began to steal pennies from the servant's pocket money . . . to purchase Indian cigarettes. . . .<br><br>But we were far from satisfied. . . . Our want of independence began to smart. It was unbearable that we should be unable to do anything without the elders' permission. At last, in sheer disgust, we decided to commit suicide!<br><br>. . . But our courage failed us. Supposing we were not instantly killed? And what was the good of killing ourselves? . . .<br><br>I realized it was not as easy to commit suicide as to contemplate it. And since then, whenever I have heard of someone threatening to commit suicide it has little or no effect on me.<br><br>The thought of suicide ultimately resulted in both of us bidding goodbye to the habit of smoking . . . and of stealing the servant's pennies. . . .7<br><br>[Presently, adult matters claimed the child's attention.]<br><br>. . . It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen. As I see the youngsters of the same age about me who are under my care, and think of my own marriage, I am inclined to pity myself and to congratulate them on having escaped my lot. I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage.<br><br>Let the reader make no mistake. I was married, not betrothed. . . . It appears that I was betrothed thrice, though without my knowledge. I was told that two girls chosen for me had died. . . .<br><br>Marriage among Hindus is no simple matter. The parents of the bride and the bridegroom often bring themselves to ruin over it. They waste their substance, they waste their time. Months are taken up over the preparations--in making clothes and ornaments and in preparing [menus] for dinners. Each tries to outdo the other in the number and variety of courses to be prepared. Women, whether they have a voice or no, sing themselves hoarse, even get ill, and disturb the peace of their neighbors. These in their turn quietly put up with all the turmoil and bustle, all the dirt and filth, representing the remains of the feast, because they know a time will come when they also will be behaving in the same manner.<br><br>. . . I do not think [my marriage] meant to me anything more than the prospect of good clothes to wear, drum beating, marriage processions, rich dinners and a strange girl to play with. The carnal desire came later. . . . Everything on that day seemed to me right and proper and pleasing. There was also my own eagerness to get married. And as everything my father did then struck me as beyond reproach, the recollection of those things is fresh in my memory. . . .<br><br>[The bride was Kasturbai, the daughter of a Porbandar merchant named Gokuldas Makanji. The marriage lasted sixty-two years.]<br><br>. . . I can picture to myself, even today, how we sat on our wedding dais, how we performed the Seven Steps, how we, the newly wedded husband and wife, put the sweet Wheat Cake into each other's mouths, and how we began to live together. And oh! That first night! Two innocent children all unwittingly hurled themselves into the ocean of life. My brother's wife had thoroughly coached me about my behavior on the first night. I do not know who had coached my wife. I have never asked her about it. . . . The reader may be sure that we were too nervous to face each other. We were certainly too shy. How was I to talk to her, and what was I to say? The coaching did not carry me far. But no coaching is really necessary in such matters. The impressions of the former birth are potent enough to make all coaching superfluous. We gradually began to know each other and to speak freely together. We were the same age. But I took no time in assuming the authority of a husband.8<br><br>. . . I had absolutely no reason to suspect my wife's fidelity but jealousy does not wait for reasons. I must needs be forever on the look-out regarding her movements and therefore she could not go anywhere without my permission. This sowed the seeds of a bitter quarrel between us. The restraint was virtually a sort of imprisonment. And Kasturbai was not the girl to brook any such thing. She made it a point to go out whenever and wherever she liked. More restraint on my part resulted in more liberty being taken by her and in my getting more and more cross. Refusal to speak to one another thus became the order of the day with us, married children. I think it was quite innocent of Kasturbai to have taken those liberties with my restrictions. How could a guileless girl brook any restraints on going to the temple or on going on visits to friends? If I had the right to impose restrictions on her, had not she also similar right? All this is clear to me today. But at the time I had to make good my authority as a husband!</p><h2>Black Enough: Stories of Being Young &amp; Black in America</h2><p><p><strong>Edited by National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi, and featuring some of the most acclaimed bestselling Black authors writing for teens today&#x2014;<em>Black Enough</em> is an essential collection of captivating stories about what it&#x2019;s like to be young and Black in America.</strong></p><p>Black is...sisters navigating their relationship at summer camp in Portland, Oregon, as written by Ren�e Watson.</p><p>Black is...three friends walking back from the community pool talking about nothing and everything, in a story by Jason Reynolds.</p><p>Black is...Nic Stone&#x2019;s high-class beauty dating a boy her momma would never approve of.</p><p>Black is...two girls kissing in Justina Ireland&#x2019;s story set in Maryland.</p><p>Black is urban and rural, wealthy and poor, mixed race, immigrants, and more&#x2014;because <em>there are countless ways to be Black enough. </em></p><em><strong>Contributors:<br>Justina Ireland<br>Varian Johnson<br>Rita Williams-Garcia<br>Dhonielle Clayton<br>Kekla Magoon<br>Leah Henderson<br>Tochi Onyebuchi<br>Jason Reynolds<br>Nic Stone<br>Liara Tamani<br>Ren�e Watson<br>Tracey Baptiste<br>Coe Booth<br>Brandy Colbert<br>Jay Coles<br>Ibi Zoboi<br>Lamar Giles</strong></em></p><p><p><strong>Ibi Zoboi</strong> was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and holds an MFA in Writing for Children &amp; Young Adults from Vermont College of Fine Arts.

Singles are staying single longer, dating is wrought with angst over purity, and marriages struggle to not interpret all forms of touch as sexual. Even the Bible seems to have endless rules about not touching things. There is simply no place where touch doesn&#x2019;t seem threatened or threatening.&nbsp;<br><br> But a curious thing happens when Jesus comes into his ministry: He touches. Jesus touches the sick and the outcast, the bleeding and the unclean.&nbsp;<br><br> What could it mean for families, singles, marriages, churches, communities, and the world to have healthy, pure, faithful, ministering touch? Somewhere in the mess of our assumptions and fears about touch, there is something beautiful and good and God-given.

But watch out...madness and mayhem lie within! Debut author Adam Lehrhaupt urges you NOT to take a walk on the wild side in this humorous, interactive romp with inventive and engaging illustrations from Eisner Award-winning comic artist and rising star children's book illustrator Matthew Forsythe.<br> <br>This quirky, subversive creation begs to be enjoyed again and again and again.</p><p><b>Adam Lehrhaupt</b> has traveled to six continents, performed on Broadway, and lived on a communal farm. He firmly believes that opening a book is a good thing, even if there are monkeys in it. Adam currently lives in the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA, with his wife and two sons. <i>Warning: Do Not Open This Book!</i> is his first book for children.Lehrhaupt&#x2019;s debut predictably counts on curious readers to ignore the dire warning and its accompanying threat, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to let the monkeys out.&#x201d; As pages turn, lemurs, baboons, and rhesus monkeys stalk into the spreads, where they pluck at the printed words and paint trees for themselves. The narrator&#x2019;s uninspired pleas to readers (&#x201c;Can you stop now? Everything used to be so good&#x201d;) scaffold Forsythe&#x2019;s (My Name Is Elizabeth!) primitive, earth-tone watercolors of the escalating melee. When a flock of toucans joins the troublemaking monkeys, and a giant alligator emerges from the right margin, readers get to be part of the solution: &#x201c;You can catch them all in this book!&#x201d; If Forsythe&#x2019;s grainy illustrations echo Jon Klassen&#x2019;s picture books, the mood in this outing is light and message-free. Source: Publishers Weekly<br><br>Children won&#x2019;t be able to resist the urge to turn the page as they wade through caution tape, warning signs, and scenes of chaos. The madcap mayhem includes monkeys stealing the illustrator&#x2019;s tools to paint their own drippy forest, a flock of swooping toucans, and an alligator sprawled across several spreads. Only the introduction of a banana trap can possibly save the story. The witty text is direct, and the art soars and leaps as much as the animals. Forsythe&#x2019;s digital art features a subtle palette of browns and grays and the characters are rendered in a bold contemporary style with simple broad strokes. In the grand tradition of books that warn children away from reading them ... this one invites readers into the action. More fun than a barrel of monkeys Source: School Library Journal<br><br>Debut author Lehrhaupt and <i>New York Times</i> Notable Children&#x2019;s Book illustrator Forsythe (<i>My Name Is Elizabeth!</i>, 2011) team up for a laugh-out-loud romp through monkey-infested pages.<br> <br> From the title and the endpapers&#x2019; warning signs (&#x201c;I guess you don&#x2019;t mind being mauled by mo___s&#x201d;) to the opening pages&#x2019; admonishments not to venture further, the narrator repeatedly warns readers not to open this book. Those who do not heed these pleas release a troop of artistic monkeys that wreak havoc on the book itself. Nothing is safe from these wild invaders&#x2014;not the art and not the text. When the narrator again urges readers to turn back, toucans join the fracas. Forsythe uses the same warm palette for the toucans as the monkeys, adding a nice continuity to an otherwise strange addition that slows down this well-paced story. Before the toucans can do much, an alligator shows up, frightening everyone. With chaos reigning supreme, the narrator turns to readers for help in laying out a plan to snare the animals inside the book. Forsythe&#x2019;s digitally rendered art is hilariously expressive and laugh-worthy in its own right, and it is well-paired with Lehrhaupt&#x2019;s spare comic text, successfully creating a book that is enjoyable both to read and behold.<br> <br> In the tradition of humorous metafictive offerings of the past, this celebration of chaos is a veritable festival of fun. Source: Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Audiences are warned right away about about opening this picture book: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to let the monkeys out.&#x201d; The intrepid and curious, though, will forge on to find a single monkey poking his head in from the edge of the page&#x2014;followed by a barrage of monkeys on the next, who muck everything up by fiddling with the text and splashing paint all over the illustrations. Continuing (and ignoring the narrator&#x2019;s pleas to stop) leads to a slew of similarly invasive toucans and finally one very large and scary alligator. All hope seems to be lost until the narrator has an idea: &#x201c;Only you can make things right. You should set a trap!&#x201d; Once the trap, a banana, has been rigged, audiences can then slam the book shut with squeals of glee, keeping the mess of creatures stuck inside... Forsythe&#x2019;s earth-toned, messy digital illustrations escalate along with the text, starting with warning signs against an austere white background but, as the critters get out of control, becoming full-bleed chaos. The art is also also reminiscent of a kid&#x2019;s watercolor paintings, a feeling enhanced by the blob-shaped monkeys and wonky alligator&#x2014;and the fact that the monkeys themselves draw the trees in the background. Kids following along will relish the exhilaration of breaking the rules as well as the simple but clever means of cleaning it all up. Expect the titular exhortation on this one to be thoroughly ignored again and again. Source: BULLETIN OF THE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS<br><br><br> <p><b><i>Warning: Do Not Open This Book!</i></b></p> <br> <b>by Adam Lehrhaupt, illus. by Matthew Forsythe</b><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> In the spirit of <i>Press Here</i> and other inventive books that play with the possibilities of the page turn, this debut from author Adam Lehrhaupt unequivocally warns children to close this book and turn away from it. So... kids won't be able to resist, just to see what their act of rebellion yields.<br> <br> "Maybe you should put this book back. You don't want to let the monkeys out," the book begins. Matthew Forsythe (<i>My Name Is Elizabeth!</i>) draws a wide-eyed monkey on a sign that says "DANGER." When children inevitably turn the page, they are greeted with, "Why did you turn the page? Didn't you see the warning? Stay on this page. You are safe here." Signs that read "Stop," "Go Back" and "U-Turn," plus barbed wire and orange pylons, suggest that readers proceed at their own risk. On the next page, a monkey appears from stage right ("Oh, no. Now you've done it"); others follow. They parade onto the pages wielding paint cans, tubes of paint and brushes ("What a mess! Naughty monkeys"). While the story warns against impending doom, children will delight in the consequences of each page turn; the monkeys' artwork results in a lush and tropical landscape of gold, forest green and burnt orange. Everything halts due to the entrance of a predator, and it's up to readers to save the naughty monkeys. <br> <br> Lehrhaupt delivers a brilliant conclusion to this hilarious romp, which involves readers to the very end. --Jennifer M. Brown, children's editor, <i>Shelf Awareness</i><br> <br> <b>Discover:</b> A picture book that warns children to walk away from it--ensuring they'll eagerly turn every page to view the consequences. Source: Shelf Awareness<br><br>Reverse psychology runs rampant in this amusing collaboration between first-time author Lehrhaupt and award-winning illustrator Forsythe. Opening this book is like venturing into a cordoned-off danger zone. Those who disobey the cover threats are met with four pages of comically dire signs: &#x201c;Come On . . . Seriously?&#x201d; and &#x201c;I Guess You Don&#x2019;t Mind Being Mauled by Monkeys.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a catch-your-breath moment after the reader turns the next page, quickly followed by a riot of monkeys barreling across a double-page spread, toting paints, crayons, and a guitar. The narrator implores the reader to get out before things get worse. And they do get worse, with the destructive monkeys being followed by toucans and an alligator that opens his jaws very, very wide. At last, the narrator supplies the reader with an ingenious way to lure the whole zoo back into the confines of the book. The earth-tone digital illustrations well replicate the messy monkey business of painting all over the trees and pages, and the playful arrangement of text adds greatly to the book&#x2019;s mayhem. Wonderful chaos.

Her heart beat in her ears and she shivered uncontrollably. Her eyes were wide and darted left and right as she took off running barefoot across the damp ground, She ran toward the plowed field ahead, in the direction that led to town. Her foot sank into the cold, damp dirt of the furrowed field. When she tried to pull her foot up, her front leg sank farther into the dirt. She threw herself forward, clawing at the dirt with bare hands, hearing the heavy, labored breathing of the person chasing her. Fear forced her from her body so that she was soon flying above herself. She looked down and could see herself stretched out in the mud below, buried to her knees, arms flailing. Some of her long brown hair was tangled in her hands in the mud. Cash circled in the air above. She looked back to see who was chasing her, but all she could see was a body, the face obscured in the darkness. Below her in the field, the body changed from herself, struggling, to a paler, longer-legged, long-haired blond. The young woman looked up at Cash and screamed, &#x201c;Help me!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>On that happy note, Cash crawled out of bed, got dressed and headed across the Red River bridge from Fargo, N.D., to the Moorhead State College campus on the other side of the river. She nursed a tepid cup of coffee, intended to get her through both her English and Biology classes, while she tried to shake the dream from her head.</p> <p>With a one-hour break between her Biology and psychology classes, Cash made a beeline for her Ranchero and retrieved her cue stick from behind the front seat, then took off across campus to the Student Union. Inside the spacious building, which also housed the cafeteria and several student study lounges, Cash headed to the billiard room where she threw her jean jacket over a tall stool that stood against the wall.</p> <p>She removed her new cue stick from the fringe leather case she had made a few years ago. The stick, with a purple ivory embossed handle was the right weight for her, a #21, and a little heavy in the handle to compensate for her short stature. She screwed the two lengths of stick together and rolled it across the green of the 9-foot table. The rec hall allowed students 24-hour access to the larger tables and no fee to play with your student ID. Her game had improved considerably since starting college. Barroom pool tables tended to be shorter so as not to take up too much drinking space. But here at the rec hall, the full-size tables were always open. Apparently, Midwest farmer-type college students weren&#x2019;t pool sharks. They spent more time writing term papers and reading textbooks.</p> <p>Cash was learning a lot at Moorhead State College. She had already found out that most girls her age considered shooting pool a sin, against their church upbringing. While Cash drank the occasional Budweiser and wore straight-legged blue jeans and a clean t-shirt under a Levi jean jacket each day, a good handful of the students preferred smoking weed to drinking. They dressed in bellbottom jeans and sheer peasant blouses - hippie attire. They talked about making love, not war. They flashed peace signs at each other as they crossed the green campus lawn. And then there were the college jocks, the students from small-town, conference-winning sports teams who were big-shot scholarship jocks now. Still the jocks were too undersized for any professional team they might hope to be scouted for. And who knew to look for them in the Red River Valley of the North anyway?</p> <p>There were also the studious students &#x2013; the students who in their small towns had been picked on, teased or ostracized because they got A&#x2019;s in algebra without cheating, who read Macbeth and enjoyed it. The ones who willingly stayed after school to create potions in the under-financed science labs of the high schools ruled by the captain of the football team and his cheerleader homecoming queen.</p> <p>Where Cash had always shot 8-ball for money, here at college, she had learned how to play 9-ball against fraternity jocks who considered it the only pool game worthy of their time. It kept her in shape for the money-making games at her home bar, the Casbah, over on the Fargo, North Dakota side of the Red River.</p> <p>It was beet-hauling season in the Valley and Cash was driving beet truck afternoons and evenings when her class schedule allowed. She had stopped at the rec hall to practice bank shots before she headed to the Wang farm around 8 in the evening to start hauling on an overnight shift. She chalked the tip of her cue and broke the rack, sending the balls spewing across the green. Her break hadn&#x2019;t been forceful enough because nothing dropped in the pockets.</p> <p>Cash started with the one ball, and successively went after each ball in numerical order, attempting a bank shot of each ball into an opposite corner. She frustrated herself with her failures. Damn and shhh...t were frequent utterances.</p> <p>She stretched her 5-foot, 2-inch frame over the pool table, her cue stick rested easily on the arch made between her thumb and curled pointer finger, aiming at the 11 ball to bank it into the far-right corner pocket. She had just pulled her right arm back in a smooth pendulous swing when, &#x201c;Cash, there you are!&#x201d; rang out. Cash&#x2019;s zone was broken and she nicked the edge of the cue ball sending it toward the 11 but about 3 inches off. Cash slid back off the table and turned to see hippie Sharon hopping down the three rec hall steps, her flared bell-bottoms swirling around her platform shoes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, I was looking all over for you after science class. I&#x2019;m in love. Do you think he&#x2019;s married? Do you think he fools around if he is? Don&#x2019;t you just love his hair, the way he kinda swoops it back over his forehead? And his bod, man.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cash leaned over the pool table and aimed at the 11 ball again. &#x201c;Who are we talking about?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Danielson.&#x201d; Sharon hopped up on the tall stool, crossed her legs and opened her long sweater jacket, her braless chest visible through the sheer gauze of her Indian style shirt. &#x201c;From now on I&#x2019;m sitting in the front seat, just like this.&#x201d; She said tossing her long blond hair over her shoulder. &#x201c;You can sit in the back row close to the door all by yourself. I want to be right up front where he can see all of me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy.&#x201d; Cash watched the 11 ball drop smoothly into the far-left pocket. She scanned the table looking for the 12 ball and calculated the best angle for a bank shot. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an old man.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s only 30.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s half dead.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mary Beth said she heard from someone that some of the teachers give A&#x2019;s for head.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What the heck are you talking about?&#x201d; Cash had to stand on tiptoe to reach across the table to line up on the 12. Cash was also learning that college hippie chicks wanted to talk about free love, weed and ending the war in Viet Nam more than anything else.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know, head, a blow job, go down on him.</p> <p>&#x201c;There are easier ways to get an A.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe for you. Do you ever study? He is so groovy.&#x201d; Sharon exaggerated the flip of her hair over her other shoulder.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thought you had a boyfriend?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you heard? Make Love, Not War.&#x201d; Sharon giggled.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come on, grab a cue and play against me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure, Miss Shark. That&#x2019;s not a game, that&#x2019;s just me moving the balls around the table for you.&#x201d; But Sharon hopped off the chair and grabbed a cue from the rack on the wall as Cash racked the balls and got a house cue to break. Once again, she didn&#x2019;t hit the balls hard enough for any of them to drop. She was going to have to spend a few sessions just practicing her shot, she could see. &#x201c;Open table,&#x201d; she said to Sharon.</p> <p>Sharon walked around the table. &#x201c;What should I shoot?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Try that solid that&#x2019;s right in front of the side pocket. Just nick the edge right here,&#x201d; Cash said pointing her finger at a spot on the purple ball. &#x201c;Nick it soft and it&#x2019;ll drop right in.&#x201d;</p> <p>Sharon slammed the cue ball into the purple ball and both dropped into the side pocket. &#x201c;Argghhh,&#x201d; she griped. &#x201c;This is why you ran out of class? To shoot pool?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, I drive shift tonight, beets, and wanted to get a few practice games in first.&#x201d; Cash ran five stripes before miscuing. &#x201c;You have solids.&#x201d;</p> <p>Sharon aimed at the 7 ball. &#x201c;Did you hear about some chick that disappeared from Dahl Hall last weekend? Kids are saying maybe she got pregnant and went home. Others are saying she hitchhiked down to the cities, but she hasn&#x2019;t come back. Her parents were at the dean&#x2019;s office this morning.&#x201d; Cash watched Sharon get a lucky break, accidently getting the 7 in. She lined up on the 3 as she chatted.</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, you got special exemption to not live in the dorm. I hate it. Curfew and &#x2018;No Boys Allowed&#x2019;.&#x201d; Sharon missed the shot. &#x201c;She was in Mr. Danielson&#x2019;s class. The sexy blonde that wore a mini-skirt and sat in the front row every class. He was always calling on her; she&#x2019;d tilt her head like this and cross her legs before answering the question. His eyes were never on her face. Bet she was getting A&#x2019;s. Your turn.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cash leaned over the table and took aim at the striped 10. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s she from?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;The girl who is missing, dingbat.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Shelly?&#x201d; Sharon answered as if asking Cash.</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Shelly. The town of Shelly?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just north of Halstad. Norman County.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, why?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothin. Just curious.&#x201d; Cash had a three-ball run and lined up to bank the fourth. She missed the shot. Still leaning over the table, contemplating at what angle she should have sent the cue ball, her eyes on the ball, without looking up she pointed her cue at Sharon, indicating it was her turn to shoot.</p> <p>Sharon said quietly, &#x201c;Um, do you have any enemies?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cash stood up and looked around, &#x201c;Not that I know of, why?&#x201d;</p> <p>Sharon, making as if to line her cue stick up with the cue ball, pointed her stick at three students standing on the steps leading into the pool table area. They all looked like they could be college students, although instead of hippie clothes they wore straight-legged jeans, t-shirts and jean jackets. Dressed just like Cash. One of the girls had her hair in two braids that hung down the front of her jacket, the other had hers pulled back in a ponytail. The guy had messy braids, like maybe he had braided them a couple days ago and hadn&#x2019;t redone them yet. None of them were smiling. They were clearly looking at Cash and Sharon. Sharon missed a straight-in shot. Cash lit a Marlboro. She took a long drag before putting the cigarette in a black plastic ashtray on the edge of the table before lining up her cue stick on the cue ball for her next shot. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the three of them come down the steps, toward the table. She shot and made the 14 and lined up on the 8 ball.</p> <p>The three students stood by the pool table, watching. Cash made the 8 ball. The guy said, &#x201c;Play partners? Me and her&#x201d; pointing at the girl with two braids, &#x201c;against you and her.&#x201d;</p> <p>Before Sharon got the &#x201c;No&#x201d; fully out of her mouth, Cash said, &#x201c;Sure. Rack &#x201c;em up.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was a silent game, clearly between Cash and the guy, their partners missing shots each turn. Sharon was so clearly nervous her cue stick shook whenever she attempted a shot. Cash played cat and mouse; not playing her best but not letting him win easily either. Playing just well enough to keep him convinced he was better than her but that maybe she was OK.</p> <p>With one ball left and the 8 ball, he asked, &#x201c;Straight 8 or last pocket?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Straight 8 is fine,&#x201d; Cash said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d; his partner finally spoke.</p> <p>&#x201c;Family&#x2019;s from White Earth. I live over in Fargo,&#x201d; Cash answered.</p> <p>&#x201c;How come we haven&#x2019;t seen you at any of the Indian student meetings?&#x201d; asked the girl with the ponytail.</p> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know there were any,&#x201d; answered Cash.</p> <p>&#x201c;Every Friday night. At Mrs. Kills Horses.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Potluck,&#x201d; said the girl with braids, missing her shot at the 8.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; asked Cash, with no intention of going.</p> <p>&#x201c;3810 10th Ave.,&#x201d; answered the guy. &#x201c;She always makes Sloppy Joes so even if no one brings anything there&#x2019;s always something.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And beer,&#x201d; said ponytail. &#x201c;If you got an ID, bring some beer.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cash rethought going. &#x201c;3810 10th Ave?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; said the guy, making the 8 ball and laying the cue across the table. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to talk about bringing AIM up from Minneapolis.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;AIM?&#x201d; It was the first time Sharon spoke since the trio had arrived.</p> <p>&#x201c;The American Indian Movement,&#x201d; answered the girl with braids, looking the blonde hippie chick up and down with a frown and one eyebrow raised.</p> <p>Sharon stared back at her, peace and love gone from her blue eyes.</p> <p>The girl with the braids looked at Cash and said, &#x201c;See you Friday.&#x201d;</p> <p>The three turned and left the rec hall. Cash re-racked the balls. &#x201c;One more game then I gotta go.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My boyfriend attended an AIM meeting down in the Cities when he was down there last year for the Miigwetch Mahnomen pow-wow. They&#x2019;re pretty radical. Red Power and all.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cash wondered to herself how Sharon knew how to pronounce miigwetch and Mahnomen so perfectly, but didn&#x2019;t ask. Instead she said, &#x201c;You said he goes to school over at NDSU?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s where most of the North Dakota Indians go. Something about the BIA money coming out of the Aberdeen office and NDSU being cheaper than sending them to school out of the Dakotas.&#x201d;</p> <p>Another thing Cash hadn&#x2019;t known before starting college. Her BIA money came out of Minneapolis, because she was enrolled at the White Earth Reservation, which was just about 45 miles east from where they were standing in Moorhead, Minnesota. When Cash registered for school she learned that she would be attending on a BIA scholarship. Her friend, Wheaton, the sheriff in Norman County, had told her how the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe had signed a treaty with the United States government that guaranteed higher education to tribal members who wanted it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you guys come to that meeting on Friday night? And I can meet Mr. Free Love,&#x201d; said Cash, breaking the rack with force. This time the 1 ball dropped in a pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got solids.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sloppy Joes and beer? I&#x2019;ll see what he says. Can&#x2019;t imagine he&#x2019;d turn that down. Only thing sweeter would be some good smoke,&#x201d; said Sharon...</p></p><h2>Lords of the Left-Hand Path: Forbidden Practices and Spiritual Heresies</h2><p>Examines the left-hand path and reveals the masters of the tradition <br> <br>� Explores the practices and beliefs of many left-hand path groups, including the Cult of Set, the Hell-Fire Club, and heretical Sufi, Zoroastrian, Christian, and Muslim sects <br> <br>� Investigates many infamous occult personalities, including Helena Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, the Marquis de Sade, and Anton LaVey <br> <br>� Explains the true difference between the right-hand path and the left-hand path--union with and dependence on God versus individual freedom and self-empowerment <br> <br>From black magic and Satanism to Gnostic sects and Gurdjieff&#x2019;s Fourth Way, the left-hand path has been linked to many practices, cults, and individuals across the ages.

Max Hastings has spent the past three years interviewing scores of participants on both sides, as well as researching a multitude of American and Vietnamese documents and memoirs, to create an epic narrative of an epic struggle. He portrays the set pieces of Dienbienphu, the Tet offensive, the air blitz of North Vietnam, and less familiar battles such as the bloodbath at Daido, where a US Marine battalion was almost wiped out, together with extraordinary recollections of Ho Chi Minhs warriors. Here are the vivid realities of strife amid jungle and paddies that killed 2 million people.Many writers treat the war as a US tragedy, yet Hastings sees it as overwhelmingly that of the Vietnamese people, of whom forty died for every American. US blunders and atrocities were matched by those committed by their enemies. While all the world has seen the image of a screaming, naked girl seared by napalm, it forgets countless eviscerations, beheadings and murders carried out by the communists. The people of both former Vietnams paid a bitter price for the Northerners victory in privation and oppression. Here is testimony from Vietcong guerrillas, Southern paratroopers, Saigon bargirls and Hanoi students alongside that of infantrymen from South Dakota, Marines from North Carolina, Huey pilots from Arkansas.No past volume has blended a political and military narrative of the entire conflict with heart-stopping personal experiences, in the fashion that Max Hastings readers know so well</p><p></p><h2>Miracle at St. Andrews: A Novel (Travis McKinley)</h2><p><b>The Miracle series continues with a pilgrimage to the mythical greens at St. Andrews. </b><b><br></b> If golf novels had a leaderboard, <i>Miracle at St. Andrews </i>would be at the top. <br>Though nobody has ever identified a single secret--no universally accepted truth--to the sport, every real player searches for one.

His construct of &#34;four ecologies&#34; examined the ways Angelenos relate to the beach, the freeways, the flatlands, and the foothills. Banham delighted in this mobile city and identified it as an exemplar of the posturban future. In a spectacular new foreword, architect and scholar Joe Day explores how the structure of Los Angeles, the concept of &#34;ecology,&#34; and the relevance of Banham&#39;s ideas have changed over the past thirty-five years.</p><p><b>Reyner Banham </b>(1922-1988) was Sheldon H.

For these X-wing fighters, no job is too dirty or too dangerous. Now they must rise to meet an impossible challenge: stop a powerful warlord by pretending to be his ally.<br><br>Against all odds, the controversial Wraith Squadron has survived its first covert mission. But now they are called upon to cheat death twice. This time Wedge Antilles sends them in to stop the warlord Zsinj and his Super Star Destroyer, Iron Fist. If Zsinj joins the Empire, it could turn the tide of war against the Rebels. The Wraith Squadron's mission: infiltrate the warlord's fleet and uncover his carefully guarded plans. To do so, they must pose as ruthless pirates seeking to join Zsinj's forces. And that means first becoming pirates in space lanes teeming with Imperial Navy patrols. If that isn't enough to get them killed, they'll have to pass one last test--a suicide mission for Zsinj.<br><br>Can they survive the test and turn the tables on Zsinj?<br><br>Or is this the end for Wraith Squadron?</p><p>Listening to books in the X-Wing series is a lot like listening to the classic radio dramas that are Star Wars' wellspring. Words, music, and sounds create a vibrant world in the mind's eye, full of action and suspense. Tony Award nominee Anthony Heald (<i>Anything Goes</i> and <i>Love! Valor! Compassion!</i> ), fashions many easily differentiated voices, human and alien--yet always with restraint, never caricature. He brings a great deal of enthusiasm to the second book in the series to feature Wraith Squadron, a collection of misfits and losers who are meant to take on the missions that no normal X-Wing squad can handle. In <i>X-Wing Iron Fist</i>, the Wraiths are assigned to help bring down the corrupt Lord Zsinj and his Super Star Destroyer, <i>Iron Fist</i>. To do so, the Wraiths must pose as pirates and try to join Zsing. For the Wraiths, though, being outlaws comes easily. This is a rousing tale that combines with the equally rousing John Williams score to create fine space opera that will be enjoyed by all ages.

Philosopher and prolific writer Peter Kreeft is up to the challenge in this work of popular apologetics aimed at both teens and adults. The masterful Kreeft tackles sixteen crucial issues about the deeper meaning of life. The questions that Kreeft explores range from, Is faith reasonable?, Can you prove there is a God?, and Why is Jesus different?, to Why is sex so confusing?, Why is there evil?, and Why must we die? Kreeft provides thoughtful, lucid, and persuasive answers for believers, unbelievers, and seekers to consider. As always, Kreeft is insightful, inspiring, and entertaining. This book is ideal for those exploring faith for the first time, as well as for confirmation and religious education classes. It&#39;s an intellectual and spiritual feast!

At once a deft parody of the American fame factory and a piercing portrait of young and old desire, this novel introduces two unforgettable characters: Grady Tripp, a former publishing prodigy now lost in a fog of pot and passion and stalled in the midst of his endless second book, and Grady&#x2019;s student, James Leer, a budding writer obsessed with Hollywood self-destruction and struggling with his own searching heart. All those who love Michael Chabon&#x2019;s <i>The Yiddish Policemen&#x2019;s Union</i> and his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i> will find the same elegant imagination, bold humor, and undeniable warmth at work in <i>Wonder Boys</i>.<br><br> &#x201c;[A] wise, wildly funny story . . .

There is, for instance, a good deal of pleasure to be had out of professor and past-prodigy Grady Tripp&#39;s awful life, as portrayed by Michael Chabon in WONDER BOYS. There is a certain amount of slapstick here, but it&#39;s balanced by Chabon&#39;s superb portrait of a gale-force mid-life crisis, a soul-destroying albatross of an unfinished novel and the mind-numbing inconsequence of writers&#39; conferences. David Colacci sounds a little starved for oxygen in his reading, but that&#39;s not exactly out of keeping with Grady Tripp&#39;s personal gestalt. K.A.P.

In this unforgettable collection, the women of York describe in their own words how they were imprisoned by abuse, rejection, and their own self-destructive impulses long before they entered the criminal justice system. Yet these are powerful stories of hope and healing, told by writers who have left victimhood behind.</p><p>In his moving introduction, Lamb describes the incredible journey of expression and self-awareness the women took through their writing and shares how they challenged him as a teacher and as a fellow author. <em>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</em> is a true testament to the process of finding oneself and working toward a better day.</p></p><p>Any book that can give voice to the voiceless should be celebrated. No one feels this more strongly than Wally Lamb, editor of <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>, a collection of stories by 11 women imprisoned in the York Correctional Institution in Connecticut. Teacher and novelist Lamb was invited to head a writing workshop at York Correctional Institution in 1999. His somewhat reluctant acceptance soon turned into steadfast advocacy once the women in his charge began to tell their stories. Lamb maintains that there are things we need to know about prison and prisoners: "There are misconceptions to be abandoned, biases to be dropped." However, as heartfelt as his appeal is, nothing speaks more convincingly in this book than the stories themselves.<p>Those collected here are disturbing and horrific. They reveal, often in graphic detail, the worst kind of abuse: incest, drug addiction, spousal violence, parental neglect, or incompetence. They're also testimony to what social workers and health care professionals have confirmed for years--that those who populate our prisons are often victims first themselves. Thus, the telling of these stories serves as a form of therapy. They are also sad accounts of the brutalities many suffer, yet few discuss: "One day I figured out a dying little girl lived inside of me, so I threw her a lifeline in the form of paper and pen." Considering the degradation the contributors have experienced both in and outside prison, the courage, candor, and honesty with which they speak truly make these stories, as difficult as they are to read, "victories against voicelessness--miracles in print." <i>--Silvana Tropea</i></p><p>Wally Lamb is the author of five <em>New York Times</em> bestselling novels: <em>She&#x2019;s Come Undone</em>, <em>I Know This Much Is True</em>, <em>The Hour I First Believed</em>, <em>Wishin&#x2019; and Hopin&#x2019;</em>, and <em>We Are Water</em>. His first two works of fiction, <em>She&#x2019;s Come Undone</em> and <em>I Know This Much Is True</em>, were both #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestsellers and<br>selections of Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club. Lamb edited <em>Couldn&#x2019;t Keep It to Myself </em>and <em>I&#x2019;ll Fly Away</em>, two volumes of essays from students in his writing workshop at York Correctional Institution, a women&#x2019;s prison in Connecticut, where he has been a volunteer facilitator for seventeen years.</p></p><h2>Textbook of Ayurveda, Volume Three: General Principles of Management and Treatment</h2><p>This book brings forth the practices of Ayurveda from the ancient texts and presents them in a systematic organization that is readily accessible to a Western audience. Vasant Lad provides comprehensive information on therapeutic modalities including diet and lifestyle recommendations, palliative and cleansing therapies, subtle healing methods including individual rejuvenation protocols, yoga and pranayama practices, and herbal substances as well as management techniques according to dosha, dhatu, srotamsi, and the subtle essences. Each section clearly explains the principles of the healing techniques, often with the steps outlined for the reader, in addition to the herbal substances and their practical application. It is an essential reference for the Ayurvedic practitioner. <p> One of Dr. Lad's favorite sutras from Charaka says that a true physician knows the body, mind, thoughts, feelings, and consciousness of the patient. Unless you enter the heart of your patient with the light of awareness, knowledge, compassion, and insight, you will not be able to diagnose their problem and treat the person accordingly. </p><p> Dr. Lad's students from all over the world learn Ayurveda, step by patient step, grounding their knowledge in the principles of a system that pre-dates Western medical concepts by thousands of years. Next, they learn the sophisticated methods of evaluation that Ayurveda provides. Mastering these techniques takes practice and dedication. The previous steps, well practiced, have prepared the student to enter into the next stage, where they can stand beside the client and guide them on their journey of healing.</p></p><p>Ayurveda finds its home in the hearts of special beings whose dharma it is to preserve and maintain traditions of wisdom for the purpose of healing themselves and the world. Bridging the gap between the changing philosophies, sciences, and religions of the ages, it is passed down in the various cultures through these dedicated individuals. Dr. Lad's heart is one of the homes for that living flame, and his life and teachings are an expression of Ayurveda s true purpose in the world. <p> Dr. Lad brings a wealth of classroom and practical experience to the United States. He received the degree of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine &amp; Surgery (B.M.A.S.) from the University of Pune, in Pune, India in 1968 and a Master of Ayurvedic Science (M.A.Sc . ) from Tilak Ayurved Mahavidyalaya in Pune, India in 1980. For 3 years he served as Medical Director of the Ayurveda Hospital in Pune, India. He also held the position of Professor of Clinical Medicine for seven years at the Pune University College of Ayurvedic Medicine, where he was an instructor for many years. Dr. Lad's academic and practical training includes the study of allopathic medicine (Western Medicine) and surgery as well as traditional Ayurveda. In 1979, he began traveling throughout the United States sharing his knowledge of Ayurveda. In 1981, he returned to New Mexico to teach Ayurveda. In 1984, he founded The Ayurvedic Institute and began as the director of the Institute. Dr. Lad is the author of numerous articles and several books including <i>Ayurveda, The Science of Self Healing,</i> and is co-author of <i>The Yoga of Herbs</i> and <i>Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing.</i> His book, <i>Secrets of the Pulse, The Ancient Art of Ayurvedic Pulse Diagnosis,</i> presents this fascinating subject for the first time. His work from Harmony Books, <i>The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies,</i> is a compendium of classic Ayurvedic treatments for common and chronic ailments. This textbook is the third volume of a four volume set. He is also the co-author of a book on marma therapy, <i>Marma Points of Ayurveda.</i> </p><p> Dr. Lad presently is the Director of The Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico where he teaches the two levels of the Ayurvedic Studies Program and the more advanced Gurukula Program in India each year. Dr. Lad also travels throughout the world, consulting privately and giving seminars on Ayurveda, its history, theory, principles, and practical applications.</p>Quintessentially brilliant. The Textbook of Ayurveda: General Principles of Management and Treatment, Volume 3 is full of practical insights that can only be delivered so succinctly by someone with the deepest knowledge of Ayurveda. With this text, Dr Lad shares the priceless gift of his wisdom that will help you fulfill Ayurveda s quest: to remove suffering and rejuvenate health.

S. Bach and lecturing about his life in the 18th century, renowned Bach tenor David Gordon has compiled this personal collection of historical anecdotes, scholarly explanations, vintage illustrations, time lines, bits of pathos, gritty descriptions of everyday life, and colorful glimpses of Bach and the world around him.<br><br>The Little Bach Book is a series of vignettes of Johann Sebastian Bach as a life-long salaried professional musician. These Bach scenes are presented in a rich context of middle-class daily life in Saxony in the early 18th century. What did people eat, drink, and wear, how did they bathe and cook? What fuels heated and illuminated their homes? How many weekly church services were there in Leipzig in 1727, and how many taverns?<br><br>The central subject of this richly illustrated book is J. S. Bach, but nearly half the pages are devoted to engaging and detailed descriptions of the everyday world that surrounded him. Both elements contain the unexpected.<br><br>This book is a refreshingly down-to-earth look at Bach's life and times, not an analysis of his music. For the newcomer to Bach, for the experienced listener, and for the general history buff, this book will be entertaining, moving, and sometimes surprising.</p><p>J. S. Bach came into my life in 1971. I was a fledgling opera singer thinking about Mozart and Rossini when I was hired to sing the narrator role ("Evangelist") in the two-hour St. John Passion. Bach's amazing music for tenor grabbed me with its "high lonesome" sound and dramatic potential.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bach became my friend, and as I studied and performed dozens of his compositions over the years I enjoyed learning about the man himself: he's way more interesting than the stern-faced marble bust on the piano.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wasn't a superstar: in the early 1700s Bach was a salaried employee with a large family living in an apartment in a major city. I was curious about daily life in those days. What did a middle-class German family eat, drink, and wear? How did they cook, or bathe, or illuminate their homes at night? How many churches were inside the city walls, and how many taverns?Answers to these questions often help make Bach more real for us. They also remind us that the "Baroque" era in Europe was the "Colonial" era on this side of the Atlantic and that Bach and we are all part of the continuum of human history.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After years of lecturing about all this, I wrote <i>The Little Bach Book</i>, a collection of my very favorite material. It's 150 pages of historical vignettes, scholarly details, bits of pathos, glimpses of real life, tales of beer, coffee and tobacco, and more.&nbsp;<i>The Little Bach Book</i>&nbsp;is not about Bach's music -- it is about his career and the everyday world around him. He had a hard life, like most musicians in the 18th century, and I believe by learning more about their lives we deepen our connections with their music and maybe with our own past.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scenes from Bach's life include the time he asked to quit his job and was thrown in jail for a month; his Friday night orchestra gig in a fashionable downtown cafe restaurant; and the outdoor torchlit concert where his trumpeter died of smoke inhalation. I also honor the deaths of Bach's first wife and ten of his children, and the sad widowhood of his second wife Anna Magdalena, who outlived him by a decade.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;300 years ago Bach wanted to entertain, stir the heart, and enlighten.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In his honor, I hope&nbsp;<i>The Little Bach Book</i>&nbsp;will do the same.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~ David Gordon, 2019A curious and charming book filled with delights. Surely every admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach has wondered about what kind of man could produce such profound music, and this book provides us with a glimpse of daily life in Leipzig in the 18th century. Where else can you find out how Bach did laundry, or how long a goose quill pen would have lasted him? There are marvelous surprises on every page."<br>Andrew Megill<br>Director of Choral Activities<br>University of Illinois</p><h2>Stories from Texas: Some of Them Are True</h2><p>Stories from Texas</p><p>W.F.

Many are familiar with the Biblical account of Babel, but after the dispersal, there was a void beyond Biblical history until empires like Rome and Greece arose. Now, discover the truth of these people groups and their civilizations that spread across the earth and trace their roots back to Babel as well as to the sons and grandsons of Noah. </p><p> </p><p>Many of today&#x2019;s scholars write off what occurred at the Tower of Babel as mythology and deny that it was a historical event. Beginning with the Biblical accounts, author Bodie Hodge researched ancient texts, critical clues, and rare historic records to help solve the mystery of what became of the failed builders of Babel. For the purpose of defending the Bible, Hodge presents these and other vital historical facts surrounding this much-debated event. Teens and older can use this layman&#x2019;s reference for Biblical classes, ancient history, apologetics training, and to realize their own cultural connection to the Bible.</p></p><p>Bodie attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC) and received a BS and MS (in 1996 and 1998 respectively) in mechanical engineering. His specialty was a subset of mechanical engineering based in advanced materials processing, particularly starting powders. <p>He conducted research for his master&#x2019;s degree through a grant from Lockheed Martin and developed a New Method of Production of Submicron Titanium Diboride. The new process was able to make titanium diboride cheaper, faster and with higher quality. This technology is essential for some nanotechnologies. </p><p> During his years at SIUC (a secular college), he continued his personal study of biblical apologetics, and even began teaching this topic to a junior high church class. While at SIUC, he was the president of one of the few Christian RSOs (Registered Student Organizations) called Christians Unlimited, and was also an officer in the student chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. </p><p> After earning his master&#x2019;s degree, he accepted a position of Visiting Instructor at SIUC and started in the fall semester of 1998. He was only 24 years old when he began teaching undergraduate engineering courses at the university. </p><p> After working for SIUC for a couple of years, Bodie accepted a position as a test engineer through Aerotek Engineering to work for Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Illinois at the Peoria Proving Ground. </p><p> While working at Caterpillar, he taught apologetics to junior high and high school students at his local church, which was a natural outcome considering his love for science, history, and theology. He did this until taking a position with Answers in Genesis in 2003. Currently, Bodie is a speaker, writer, and researcher on a host of topics, including fall of Satan and related events. </p><p> Bodie was saved when he was nine.

It could&#x2019;ve been weeks or even months. I&#x2019;d lost track of time in this small, cold cell, with only a rough stone floor for a bed. My captors kept me awake or asleep, at their discretion, with the help of some drug that made it impossible to count the days. For a while, I&#x2019;d been certain they were slipping it to me in my food or water, so I&#x2019;d gone on a hunger strike. The only thing that had accomplished was a forced feeding&#x2014;something I never, ever wanted to experience again&#x2014;and no escape from the drug. I&#x2019;d finally realized they were piping it in through the ventilation system, and unlike with food, I couldn&#x2019;t go on an air strike.<br><br>For a while, I&#x2019;d had the fanciful idea that I&#x2019;d track time with my menstrual cycle, the way that women in primitive societies synced themselves up to the moon. My captors, proponents of cleanliness and efficiency, had even provided feminine hygiene products for when the time came. That plan failed as well, though. Being abruptly cut off from birth control pills at the time of my capture reset all my hormones and spun my body into irregular cycles that made it impossible to measure anything, especially when combined with my wacky sleep schedule. The only thing I could be certain of was that I wasn&#x2019;t pregnant, which was a huge relief. If I&#x2019;d had Adrian&#x2019;s child to worry about, the Alchemists would&#x2019;ve had unlimited power over me. But it was just me in this body, and I could take whatever they threw at me. Hunger, cold. It didn&#x2019;t matter. I refused to let them break me.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you thought about your sins, Sydney?&#x201d;<br><br>The metallic, female voice reverberated around the small cell, seeming to come from every direction at once. I pulled myself up into a sitting position, tugging my rough shift down over my knees. It was more out of habit than anything else. The sleeveless garment was so paper thin that it offered no warmth whatsoever. The only thing it provided was a psychological sense of modesty. They&#x2019;d given it to me partway through my captivity, claiming it was a token of goodwill. In reality, I think the Alchemists just couldn&#x2019;t handle keeping me there naked, especially when they saw it wasn&#x2019;t getting to me the way they&#x2019;d hoped.<br><br>&#x201c;I slept,&#x201d; I said, stifling a yawn. &#x201c;No time to think.&#x201d; The drug in the air seemed to keep me perpetually sleepy, but they were also sending in some stimulant that made sure I stayed awake when they wanted, no matter how exhausted I might be. The result was that I never felt fully rested&#x2014;as was their intent. Psychological warfare worked best when the mind was weary.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you dream?&#x201d; the voice asked. &#x201c;Did you dream of redemption? Did you dream of what it might be like to see the light again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I was being uncharacteristically talkative today. They asked me these questions all the time, and sometimes I just stayed silent. &#x201c;But if you want to stop feeding me that sedative for a while, maybe I&#x2019;ll get some real sleep and have some dreams that we can chat about.&#x201d;<br><br>More importantly, getting real sleep that was free of these drugs meant that Adrian would be able to locate me in my dreams and help me find a way out of this hellhole.<br><br>Adrian.<br><br>His name alone had gotten me through many long, dark hours. Thoughts of him, of our past and of our future, were what had helped me survive my present. I often lost myself in daydreams, thinking back to the handful of months we&#x2019;d had together. Had it really been so short? Nothing else in my nineteen years seemed as vivid or meaningful as the time I&#x2019;d spent with him. My days were consumed with thoughts of him. I would replay each precious memory, the joyous and the heartbreaking, and when I&#x2019;d exhausted them, I&#x2019;d fantasize about the future. I&#x2019;d live out all the possible scenarios we&#x2019;d imagined for ourselves, all our silly &#x201c;escape plans.&#x201d;<br><br>Adrian.<br><br>He was the reason I was able to survive in this prison.<br><br>And he was also the reason I was here in the first place.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need your subconscious to tell you what your conscious already knows,&#x201d; the voice told me. &#x201c;You are tainted and impure. Your soul is shrouded in darkness, and you have sinned against your own kind.&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed at this old rhetoric and shifted, trying to make myself more comfortable, though it was a losing battle. My muscles had been in a perpetual state of stiffness for ages now. There was no comfort to be found in these conditions.<br><br>&#x201c;It must make you sad,&#x201d; the voice continued, &#x201c;to know that you&#x2019;ve broken your father&#x2019;s heart.&#x201d;<br><br>That was a new approach, one that caught me off guard enough that I spoke without thinking: &#x201c;My father doesn&#x2019;t have a heart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He does, Sydney. He does.&#x201d; Unless I was mistaken, the voice sounded a bit pleased at having drawn me out. &#x201c;He greatly regrets the fall you&#x2019;ve taken. Especially when you showed such promise to us and our fight against evil.&#x201d;<br><br>I scooted over so that I could lean against the rough-cut wall. &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s got another daughter who&#x2019;s much more promising now, so I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll get over it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You broke her heart too. Both of them are more grieved than you could ever know. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to reconcile with them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you offering me that chance?&#x201d; I asked cautiously.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been offering you that chance from the beginning, Sydney. Just say the words, and we will gladly begin your path to redemption.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying this hasn&#x2019;t been part of it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This has been part of the effort to help you cleanse your soul.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Helping me through starvation and humiliation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want to see your family or not? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to sit down and talk to them?&#x201d;<br><br>I made no answer and instead tried to puzzle out what game was afoot. The voice had offered me many things in captivity, most of them creature comforts&#x2014;warmth, a soft bed, real clothes. I&#x2019;d been offered other rewards too, like the cross necklace Adrian had made for me and food far more substantial and appetizing than the gruel they currently kept me alive on. They&#x2019;d even tried to tempt with that last one by piping in the aroma of coffee. Someone&#x2014;possibly that family that cared so much about me&#x2014;had tipped them off to my preferences.<br><br>But this . . . the chance to see and talk to people was a whole new thing altogether. Admittedly, Zoe and my dad weren&#x2019;t exactly at the top of the list of whom I&#x2019;d want to see right now, but it was the larger scope of what the Alchemists were offering that interested me: a life outside of this cell.<br><br>&#x201c;What would I have to do?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;ve always known you had to do,&#x201d; responded the voice. &#x201c;Admit your guilt. Confess your sins, and say you&#x2019;re ready to redeem yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>I nearly said, I have nothing to confess. It was what I&#x2019;d told them a hundred times before this. Maybe even a thousand times. But I was still intrigued. Meeting with other people meant that surely they&#x2019;d have to turn off that poison in the air . . . right? And if I could escape that, I could dream. . . .<br><br>&#x201c;I just say those words, and I get to see my family?&#x201d;<br><br>The voice was irritatingly condescending. &#x201c;Not right away, of course. It has to be earned. But you would be able to move on to the next stage of your healing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Re-education,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Your tone makes it sound like a bad thing,&#x201d; said the voice. &#x201c;We do it to help you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No thanks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting used to this place. Shame to leave it.&#x201d;<br><br>That, and I knew re-education was where the real torture would begin. Sure, it might not be as physically challenging as this, but that was where they really honed in on the mind control. These harsh conditions were a setup, to make me feel weak and helpless so that I&#x2019;d be susceptible to when they tried to alter my mind in re-education. So that I&#x2019;d be grateful and thank them for it.<br><br>And yet, I couldn&#x2019;t shake that thought again, that if I did leave here, I might be in a position to sleep and dream normally again. If I could make that contact with Adrian, everything might change. At the very least, I would know he was okay . . . if I survived re-education itself. I could make guesses at the kind of psychological manipulation they&#x2019;d try on me but didn&#x2019;t know for sure. Would I endure it? Could I keep my mind intact, or would they turn me against all my principles and loved ones? That was the risk of leaving this cell. I knew also that the Alchemists had drugs and tricks to make their commands &#x201c;stick,&#x201d; so to speak, and although I was probably protected against them, thanks to regular magic use before I&#x2019;d been imprisoned, the fear that I might still be vulnerable nagged at me. The only certain way I knew to protect against their compulsion was through a potion I&#x2019;d once made and successfully used on a friend&#x2014;but not on myself.<br><br>Further ruminations were put on hold as I felt fatigue wash over me. Apparently, this conversation was over. I knew enough now not to fight and stretched out on the floor, letting thick, dreamless sleep wash over me, burying thoughts of freedom. But before the drug took me down, I said his name in my mind, using it as a touchstone to keep me strong.<br><br>Adrian . . .<br><br>� � �<br><br>I woke at an unspecified time later and found food in my cell. It was the usual gruel, some kind of boxed hot cereal that was probably fortified with vitamins and minerals to keep my health up, such as it was. Calling it &#x201c;hot cereal&#x201d; might have been generous, however. &#x201c;Lukewarm&#x201d; was more adequate. They had to make it as unappetizing as possible. Tasteless or not, I ate automatically, knowing I needed to keep my strength up for when I got out of here.<br><br>If I get out of here.<br><br>The traitorous thought reared up before I could stop it. It was a longtime fear that had nagged at my edges, the terrifying possibility that they might keep me here forever, that I would never see any of the people I loved again&#x2014;not Adrian, not Eddie, not Jill, not any of them. I would never practice magic again. I would never read a book again. That last thought hit me particularly hard today because as much as daydreaming about Adrian carried me through these dark hours, I would&#x2019;ve killed to have something as mundane as a trashy novel to read. I would&#x2019;ve settled for a magazine or pamphlet. Anything that wasn&#x2019;t darkness and that voice.<br><br>Be strong, I told myself. Be strong for yourself. Be strong for Adrian. Would he do any less for you?<br><br>No, he wouldn&#x2019;t. Wherever he was, whether he was still in Palm Springs or had moved on, I knew Adrian would never give up on me, and I had to match that. I had to be ready for when we were together. I had to be ready for when we were reunited.<br><br>Centrum permanebit. The Latin words played through my mind, strengthening me. Translated, they meant &#x201c;The center will hold&#x201d; and were a play off a poem Adrian and I had read. We are the center now, I thought. And he and I will hold, no matter what.<br><br>I finished my meager meal and then attempted a cursory washing at the small sink in the cell&#x2019;s corner, feeling my way in the dark to where it sat by a small toilet. A real bath or shower was out of the question (though they&#x2019;d used that as bait before, too), and I had to clean myself daily (or what I thought was daily) with a rough washcloth and cold water that smelled of rust. It was humiliating, knowing they were watching with their night vision cameras, but it was still more dignified than staying dirty. I wouldn&#x2019;t give them that satisfaction. I would stay human, even if that was the very charge they were questioning me on.<br><br>When I was clean enough, I curled back up against the wall, my teeth chattering as my wet skin shivered in the cold air. Would I ever be warm again?<br><br>&#x201c;We spoke to your father and sister, Sydney,&#x201d; said the voice. &#x201c;They were so sad to hear that you didn&#x2019;t want to see them. Zoe cried.&#x201d;<br><br>Internally, I winced, regretting that I played along last time. The voice now thought this family tactic had some leverage over me. How could they think I&#x2019;d want to bond with the people who&#x2019;d locked me up here? The only family I might have wanted to see&#x2014;my mom and my older sister&#x2014;probably weren&#x2019;t on the visitor list, especially if my dad had gotten his way in their divorce proceedings. Thatoutcome actually was something I would&#x2019;ve liked to hear about, but no way would I let on to that.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you regret the pain you&#x2019;ve caused them?&#x201d; asked the voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Zoe and Dad should regret the pain they caused me,&#x201d; I snapped back.<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t want to cause you pain.&#x201d; The voice was trying to be soothing, but mostly I wanted to punch whoever was behind it&#x2014;and I wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person usually given to violence. &#x201c;They did what they did to help you. That&#x2019;s all we&#x2019;re trying to do. They&#x2019;d love the chance to talk to you and explain themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they would,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;If you even talked to them.&#x201d; I hated myself for engaging with my captors. This was the most I&#x2019;d spoken to them in a while. They had to be loving it.<br><br>&#x201c;Zoe asked us if it would be okay if she brought you a skinny vanilla latte when she visits. We told her it would. We&#x2019;re all for a civilized visit, for you to sit down and truly talk, so that your family and especially your soul can heal.&#x201d;<br><br>My heart beat rapidly, and it had nothing to do with the lure of coffee. The voice was confirming again what had been suggested before. A real visit, sitting down, drinking coffee . . . that had to take place out of this cell. If any of this fantasy were even true, there was no way they&#x2019;d bring my dad and Zoe here&#x2014;not that seeing them was my goal. Getting out of here was. I still maintained that I could stay here forever, that I could take whatever they threw at me. And I could. But what was I accomplishing? All I proved was my own toughness and defiance, and while I was proud of those things, they weren&#x2019;t getting me any closer to Adrian. To get to Adrian, to get the rest of my friends . . . I needed to dream. To dream, I needed to get away from this drugged existence.<br><br>And not just that. If I were somewhere that wasn&#x2019;t a small, dark cell, I might be able to work magic again. I might have a clue about where in the world they&#x2019;d taken me. I might be able to free myself.<br><br>But first I had to leave this cell. I&#x2019;d thought I was brave staying here, but suddenly, I wondered if getting out was what would truly test my courage.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like that, Sydney?&#x201d; Unless I was mistaken, there was an edge of excitement in the voice&#x2014;almost an eagerness&#x2014;that contrasted with the lofty and imperious tone I&#x2019;d grown used to. They&#x2019;d never sparked this much interest from me. &#x201c;Would you like to begin the first steps toward purging your soul&#x2014;and seeing your family?&#x201d;<br><br>How long had I languished in this cell, moving in and out of agitated consciousness? When I felt my torso and arms, I could tell I&#x2019;d lost a considerable amount of weight, the kind of weight loss that took weeks. Weeks, months . . . I had no idea. And while I was here, the world was going on without me&#x2014;a world full of people who needed me.<br><br>&#x201c;Sydney?&#x201d;<br><br>Not wanting to sound too eager, I tried to stall. &#x201c;How do I know I can trust you? That you&#x2019;ll let me see my family if I . . . begin this journey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Evil and deception are not our ways,&#x201d; the voice said. &#x201c;We relish in light and honesty.&#x201d;<br><br>Liars, liars, I thought. They&#x2019;d lied to me for years, telling me good people were monsters and trying to dictate the way I lived my life. But it didn&#x2019;t matter. They could keep their word or not about my family.<br><br>&#x201c;Will I have . . . a real bed?&#x201d; I managed to make my voice choke a little.

A century ago, Christianity was still primarily centered in North America and Europe. By the dawn of the twenty-first century, Christianity had become a truly global faith, with Christians in Asia, Africa and Latin America outpacing those in the rest of the world. There are now more Christians in China than in all of Europe, more Pentecostals in Brazil than in the United States, and more Anglicans in Kenya than in Great Britain, Canada and the United States combined. Countries that were once destinations for western missionaries are now sending their own missionaries to North America. Given these changes, some think the day of the Western missionary is over. Some are wary that American mission efforts may perpetuate an imperialistic colonialism. Some say that global outreach is best left to indigenous leaders. Others simply feel that resources should be focused on the home front. Is there an ongoing role for the North American church in global mission? Missions specialist Paul Borthwick brings an urgent report on how the Western church can best continue in global mission. He provides a current analysis of the state of the world and how Majority World leaders perceive North American Christians' place. Borthwick offers concrete advice for how Western Christians can be involved without being paternalistic or creating dependency. Using their human and material resources with wise and strategic stewardship, North Americans can join forces with the Majority World in new, interdependent ways to answer God?s call to global involvement. In this critical age, the global body of Christ needs one another more than ever. Discover how the Western church can contribute to a new era of mission marked by mutuality, reciprocity and humility.</p><p><strong>Paul Borthwick</strong> is senior consultant for Development Associates International and teaches missions at Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. His books include <em>A Mind for Missions, How to Be a World-Class Christian</em> and <em>Six Dangerous Questions to Transform Your View of the World.</em>"Written in popular style, this book deserves a wide reading in the North American context. Majority World readers should also find it instructive. Relevant roles still remain for North Americans, but new attitudes and strategies will be required. <em>Western Christians in Global Mission</em> offers intentional strategies to the humble so that a new era of missions can be discovered and learned together with genuine partners from the Majority World." (Tom Steffan, Missiology, 42(1))<br><br>"Borthwick's insights and recommendations, the product of decades of extensive world travel, research, teaching and strong relationships with leaders in the Global Church, make this book a valuable resource for anyone involved in long or short term cross-cultural missions, and for those who are calling them out and preparing them to go." (Hayward Armstrong, Renewing Minds)<br><br>"This book provides practical ideas on how the Western church can best continue in global mission&#x2015;without being paternalistic or creating dependency&#x2015;by using its human and material resources with strategic wisdom marked by a posture of humility, purposeful reciprocity and partnership equality." (Robert L. Gallagher, Outreach Magazine, 11th Annual Resources of the Year: Global Outreach "Also Recommended," March/April 2014)<br><br>"Borthwick introduces Western readers (especially Americans!) to what they need to know to engage the diversity of global Christian faith. Offering both critique and encouragement, he reminds us of how Americans perceive themselves and how they are perceived by sisters and brothers around the world. It's a solid dose of humility to offset our pride at being so-called world leaders." (Scott Moreau, "The 2014 Christianity Today Book Awards," Christianity Today, January/February 2014)<br><br>"Professors and students of missions will find this a supportive companion to other readings. He remains frank, yet humble, and positive from start to finish. The wider this book circulates in schools, churches and mission agencies, the better for the advancement of the good news in this country." (Paul W. Shea, Evangelical Missions Quarterly, October 2013)<br><br>"Paul Borthwick has done it again! The prolific writer, motivator, educator and mentor this time acts as a well-informed, reliable and creative global missions tour guide. He takes us on a journey which compels us to rethinking as well as reengagement. I am glad that after a global missionary pilgrimage he takes us back to his home base, for I have a deep conviction that the U.S. is still God's most forward nation. Borthwick's biblical passion, personal touch and global experience make him a competent interpreter and builder of bridges between what God is doing in America and the rest of the world. Read, reorient and act!" (Peter Kuzmic, distinguished professor of world missions and European studies at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and founding president of Evandeoski Teoloski Fakultet, Osijek, Croatia)<br><br>"Today's huge changes in the world and the church are bewildering to navigate. How can we be part of what God has called all believers to be and do--his witnesses in a hurting and needy world? Paul Borthwick's analysis of the global church comes from his friendships with many in the Majority World. Writing as a reflective practitioner, Paul helps Western Christians face critical issues of attitude, heart and strategy with grace, courage, crosscultural sensitivity and a learner's heart. This book presents a strong, clear invitation to missional living. It will help you align yourself and your church with what God is doing in his world today." (Jeanette Yep, pastor of regional and global outreach, Grace Chapel, Lexington, Massachusetts)<br><br>"For decades Paul Borthwick has persevered in his call to travel the world and teach the way the best teaching is done: to small groups of leaders who have become his friends. This has given him an excellent opportunity to sense the pulse of the life of Christians in the Majority World. Now he has used this knowledge, and augmented it with wide reading, to address his own people in what may be the most important book he has written." (Ajith Fernando, teaching director, Youth for Christ, Sri Lanka)<br><br>"Why do I think this is one of the best and most helpful books on the global realities of world mission that I have read? It can't be only because so many of the people from all over the world whom Paul Borthwick quotes or tells stories about are known to me--though they are, and they are wise and trusted sources. It can't be only because the book embodies a comprehensive, biblical and integrated understanding of what mission includes (the chapter on the 'Nine Greats' is worth the price of the book). It won my applause because it has such a pleasing balance of, on the one hand, rich, up-to-date, well-documented and user-friendly information, and on the other hand perceptive honesty and realism about the strengths and the failings of the churches in North America and in the Majority World. The author also models in his personal journey the humility and servanthood that he urges on all of us. And finally, it is a book that is not merely inspirational, but constantly practical and brimming with ideas and responses that should stimulate churches, agencies and individuals." (Christopher J. H. Wright, international director of Langham Partnership and author of The Mission of God and The Mission of God's People)<br><br>"<em>Western Christians in Global Mission</em> combines up-to-date analysis of what God is doing worldwide with passionate commitment to obeying and fulfilling the Great Commission. Here is a textbook for students, a guidebook for missions leaders, a study book for small groups and a challenge book for every Christian."

A General Introduction sets the <i>Library</i> and <i>Fabulae</i> into the wider context of ancient mythography; introductions to each text discuss in greater detail issues of authorship, aim, and influence. A general index, an index of people and geographic locations, and an index of authors and works cited by the mythographers are also included.</p></p><p><p>Stephen M. Trzaskoma is Professor of Classics, University of New Hampshire.</p><p>R. Scott Smith is Associate Professor of Classics, University of New Hampshire.</p><p>To refer to this volume as just a translation is misleading, because Smith and Trzaskoma have provided much more, most notably the best short introduction to ancient mythography--and these particular authors--available in English. . . . The translations themselves are clear and accurate. [An] admirable volume. Smith and Trzaskoma are to be commended. --Kris Fletcher, <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i></p><br><br><p>Every student and scholar of Greek mythology and the mythographic tradition will want to own this book, and every library should have it on the shelf. Smith and Trzaskoma have produced an indispensable volume that is easy to use and understand. They have invested a tremendous amount of time and scholarship to make this a valuable resource for traditionalists and non-traditionalists alike. Even the general reader can benefit from their judicious essays, thoughtful translations, and concise textual notes. Teachers of mythology will welcome this handbook for its readability and applicability to general mythology books currently in use. Everything about this work will make it the standard handbook for years to come. --Paul Properzio, <i>The Classical Journal</i></p><br><br><p>These two translations are excellent, finding a good balance of accuracy and readability. . . . the Apollodorus, which has a few relatively recent competitors, adopts a style that will be much more welcome to readers than other renderings currently available. The translation of the <i>Fabulae</i> will be especially welcome for teaching, since it is difficult to find this in a readable English version. The General Introduction strikes a balance--both informed and informal--that will appeal to instructors and students. There is certainly nowhere else one can go to find such a succinct yet thorough discussion of these major Greek mythographers. . . the discussion remains readable, focused, and pleasantly informal. The maps and genealogical charts are excellent and useful. . . these charts create something truly useful for student readers. --Daniel W.

He alternated between longish, sprawling 20- or 30-page adventure yarns filled with the romance of danger, courage, and derring-do, whose exotic locales spanned the globe, and shorter stories that usually revolved around crazily ingenious domestic squabbles between Donald and members of the Duckburg cast. Highlights include: <br>� The title story, "Lost in the Andes" (Barks's own favorite). Donald and the nephews embark on an expedition to Peru to find where square eggs come from only to meet danger in a mysterious valley whose inhabitants all speak with a southern drawl, and where Huey, Dewey, and Louie save Unca' Donald's life by learning how to blow square bubbles! <br>� Two stories co-starring the unbearably lucky Gladstone, including the epic "Race to the South Seas," as Donald and Gladstone try to win Uncle Scrooge's favor by being the first to rescue him from a desert island. <br>� Two Christmas stories, including "The Golden Christmas Tree," one of Barks's most fantastic stories that pits him and the nephews against a witch who wants to destroy all the Christmas trees in the world. <br>� In other stories, Donald plays a TV quiz show contestant and ends up encased in a giant barrel of gelatin, a truant officer who matches wits with his nephews, and a ranch hand who outwits cattle rustlers. <br></p><p>Carl Barks (1901-2000) spent most of his life in Oregon. In 1987, he was one of the three inaugural inductees in the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame (along with Eisner and Jack Kirby). He&#39;s also a Disney Legend.&#x201c;A priceless part of our literary heritage.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Lucas</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Barks taught me that comics could be high art, and I consider his work to be <strong>the best storytelling I&#x2019;ve experienced in any form</strong>. ...Fantagraphics... is publishing the Barks collection in beautiful hardcover books that do great honor to the cartoonist and his stories, and I can&#x2019;t wait to buy them for my kids. Proof that great storytelling endures from generation to generation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeff Kinney (author of the <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> series)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Carl Barks was a great storyteller... We had a deep appreciation of [his] comics when we were kids. We read his stories over and over again. Nobody knew his name. We just called him &#x2018;The Good Artist&#x2019; because he was so much better than all the other Disney artists.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>R.

By the 1920s she had amassed a fortune and went on to create an empire. But her life from 1941 to 1954 has long been shrouded in rumor and mystery, never clarified by Chanel or her many biographers. Hal Vaughan exposes the truth of her wartime collaboration and her long affair with the playboy Baron Hans G�nther von Dincklage&#x2014;who ran a spy ring and reported directly to Goebbels. Vaughan pieces together how Chanel became a Nazi agent, how she escaped arrest after the war and joined her lover in exile in Switzerland, and how&#x2014;despite suspicions about her past&#x2014;she was able to return to Paris at age seventy and rebuild the iconic House of Chanel.<br></p><p><b>Hal Vaughan</b> has been a newsman, foreign correspondent, and documentary film producer working in Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia since 1957. He served in the U.S. military in World War II and Korea and has held various posts as a U.S. Foreign Service officer. Vaughan is the author of <i>Doctor to the Resistance:</i> <i>The Heroic True Story of an American Surgeon and His Family in Occupied Paris</i> and <i>FDR&#x2019;s 12 Apostles: The Spies Who Paved the Way for the Invasion of North Africa</i>. He lives in Paris.PROLOGUE<br><br>Despite her age she sparkles; she is the only volcano in the Auvergne that is not extinct . . . the most brilliant, the most impetuous, the most brilliantly insufferable woman that ever was.<br><br>Gabrielle Chanel had barely been laid to rest in her designer sepulcher at Lausanne, Switzerland, when the city of Paris announced that France&#x2019;s first lady and Chanel&#x2019;s admirer and client, the wife of French president Georges Pompidou, would open an official exhibit celebrating Chanel&#x2019;s life and work in Paris in October 1972. Shortly before, Hebe Dorsey, the legendary fashion editor of the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, reported the &#x201c;homage to Chanel&#x201d; probably would be canceled or, at the very least, postponed. Dorsey revealed that Pierre Galante, an editor at <i>Paris Match</i>, would soon expose shocking documents from French counterintelligence archives. Dorsey alleged that Chanel had had an affair during the German occupation of Paris with Baron Hans Gu&#x308;nther von Dincklage: &#x201c;a dangerous agent of the German information service&#x2014;likely an agent of the Gestapo.&#x201d;<br><br>Chanel, the epitome of French good taste, in bed with a Nazi spy&#x2014;worse yet, involved with an agent of the hated Gestapo? To the French, and especially to French Jews, veterans of the Resistance, and survivors of SS- run concentration camps, German collaborators were pariahs or, worse, fit to be spat upon. Granted, for years fashionable Paris had gossiped that Chanel had shacked up during the occupation with a German lover called Spatz&#x2014;German for sparrow&#x2014; at the chic H�tel Ritz where Nazi bigwigs like Hermann G�ring and Joseph Goebbels were pampered by the Swiss management. But the Gestapo? Hadn&#x2019;t Chanel dressed Mme Pompidou? Hadn&#x2019;t she been honored at the �lys�e Palace? How could such an icon of French society have bedded a &#x201c;German spy&#x201d;? It was hard to believe. Even though tens of thousands of French men and women <i>collabos </i>had escaped punishment, being a willing bedmate and helpmate of a German offi cer still reeked of treason in 1972. Their liaison would last over ten years, leading one observer to wonder if Chanel &#x201c;cared about political ideology but wanted instead to be loved and to hell with politics.&#x201d;<br><br>The timing for the proposed national celebration of Chanel&#x2019;s life and work could hardly have been worse. On top of everything else, the U.S. publisher Alfred A. Knopf had just released <i>Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order</i>, 1940&#x2013;1944 by American historian Robert O. Paxton. This study of the Vichy regime under Marshal Philippe P�tain left many French scholars chagrined and upstaged on their own academic home turf. Based on material from German archives&#x2014; because the French government had forbidden access to the Vichy archives&#x2014; Paxton&#x2019;s book proved that P�tain&#x2019;s collaboration with this particular cohort of full- blooded Nazis had been voluntary rather than forced on Vichy.<br><br>For the Pompidou political machine facing an election in just twenty-four months and for the Chanel organization confronting allegations that its founder had been linked to the Gestapo, postponement of the &#x201c;homage to Chanel&#x201d; was the only option. There was also solid and damning evidence of her collaboration in an upcoming biography by Pierre Galante&#x2014; scheduled for publication in Paris and New York. A former resistance fighter and husband of English actress Olivia de Havilland, Galante claimed his information was based on access to French counterintelligence sources.<br><br>Le Tout-Paris was talking about the book before it was even published. Edmonde Charles-Roux, a Goncourt Prize&#x2013;winning novelist, was outraged by Galante&#x2019;s revelations. She labeled his claims nonsense: [Dincklage] &#x201c;was not in the Gestapo.&#x201d; Spatz and Chanel, she maintained, just enjoyed an amorous friendship. (Madame Charles- Roux was also writing a Chanel biography and presumably did not have access to Galante&#x2019;s sources.)<br><br>Marcel Haedrich, an earlier Chanel biographer, claimed that Spatz was merely a bon vivant who &#x201c;loved eating, wines, cigars, and beautiful clothes . . . thanks to Chanel he had an easy life . . . he waited for her in her salon . . . he would kiss Chanel&#x2019;s hand and murmur: &#x201c; &#x2018;how are you this morning?&#x2019; &#x201d;&#x2014;and because the two spoke English together she would say, &#x201c;He is not German, his mother was English.&#x201d;<br><br>Asked by <i>Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily</i>, the New York garment industry paper, in September 1972: &#x201c;[W]as Chanel, Paris&#x2019;s greatest couturi�re, really an agent for the Gestapo?&#x201d; Charles-Roux replied, &#x201c;[Dincklage] was not in the Gestapo. He was attached to a commission here [in Paris] and he did give information. He had a dirty job. But we must remember, it was war and he had the misfortune to be a German.&#x201d; Years later, Charles- Roux learned that she had been duped&#x2014; manipulated by Chanel and her lawyer, Ren� de Chambrun.<br>The liberation of Paris in August 1944 began with bloody street fighting, pitting German troopers against a scruffy, ragtag band of General Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s irregular street fighters called Forces Fran�aises de l&#x2019;Int�rieur (the FFI), which Chanel would dub &#x201c;les Fifis.&#x201d; They were joined by Communist fighters, Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), and civilian police offi cers. Facing German forces, some resistants were armed only with light police weapons; others had World War I&#x2013;vintage revolvers and rifles; a few had Molotov cocktails and weapons seized from dead Boches. The street fighters were often young students, their sleeves rolled up on bony arms and wearing sandals. Their FFI, FTP, and police armbands served as uniforms.<br><br>In the last week of August the U.S.-equipped Free French Army, led by General Leclerc, nom de guerre for Philippe de Hauteclocque, relieved the Paris insurgency, and the German garrison surrendered. After four years of often- brutal occupation, Paris was liberated&#x2014; free from the threat of arrest, torture, and deportation to concentration camps. Church bells rang, whistles blew; people danced in the streets. Except for some provinces, such as Alsace and Lorraine, France was under General Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s Free French.<br><br>A thirst for revenge gripped the nation in the last days of August. Four years of shame, pent-up fear, hate, and frustration erupted. Revengeful citizens roamed the streets of French cities and towns. The guilty&#x2014; and many innocents&#x2014; were punished as private scores were settled. Many alleged collaborators were beaten; some murdered. &#x201c;Horizontal collaborators&#x201d;&#x2014;women and girls who were known to have slept with Germans&#x2014; were dragged through the streets. A few would have the swastika branded into their flesh; many would have their heads shaved. Civilian<i> collabos</i>&#x2014;even some physicians who had treated the Boche&#x2014;were shot on sight. The lucky were jailed, to be tried later for treason. Finally, General de Gaulle&#x2019;s soldiers and his provisional magistrates put a stop to this internecine war.<br><br>The twentieth-century <i>monstre sacr�</i> of fashion, Chanel was among those marked for vengeance. The French called it <i>�puration</i>&#x2014; a purge, a cleansing of France&#x2019;s wounds after so many had died and suffered under Nazi rule.<br><br>Within days after the last German troopers left Paris, Chanel hurried to give out bottles of Chanel No. 5 to American GIs. Then the Fifi s arrested her. Truculent young men brought her to an FFI headquarters for questioning.<br><br>Chanel was released within a few hours, saved by the intervention of Winston Churchill operating through Duff Cooper, the British ambassador to de Gaulle&#x2019;s French provisional government. A few days later, she fl ed to Lausanne, Switzerland, where she would later be joined by Dincklage&#x2014;still a handsome man at forty-eight. Chanel was sixty- one years old.<br>De Gaulle &#x2019;s government soon ordered Ministry of Justice magistrates to use special courts to try those suspected of aiding the Nazi regime&#x2014; a crime under the French criminal code. Among the first to be tried were Vichy chief Philippe P�tain and his prime minister, Pierre Laval. Both were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. De Gaulle spared P�tain because of his old age, but Laval was shot.<br><br>During the postwar process of cleansing, French military and civilian courts tried or examined 160,287 cases in all. While 7,037 people were condemned to death, only about 1,500 were actually executed. The rest of the death sentences were commuted to prison sentences.<br><br>It took nearly two years after the Liberation before a French Court of Justice issued an &#x201c;urgent&#x201d; warrant to bring Chanel before French authorities. On April 16, 1946, Judge Roger Serre ordered police and French border patrols to bring her to Paris for questioning. A month later he ordered a full investigation of her wartime activities. It wasn&#x2019;t Chanel&#x2019;s relations with Dincklage that attracted Serre&#x2019;s attention. Rather, the judge had discovered that Chanel had cooperated with German military intelligence and had been teamed with a French traitor, Baron Louis de Vaufreland. French police had identifi ed the baron as a thief and wartime German agent who was tagged as a &#x201c;V- Mann&#x201d; on German Abwehr documents&#x2014; meaning, in the parlance of the Gestapo and German intelligence agencies, that he was a trusted agent.<br><br>Serre, forty-eight years old and with more than twenty years of experience as a magistrate, grilled Vaufreland for months. Serre also learned from French intelligence offi cers how Vaufreland and Chanel had collaborated with the German military. Slowly, Serre, a painstaking investigator, turned up details of Chanel&#x2019;s Abwehr recruitment, her collaboration with Vaufreland, and how she and the German spy had embarked on an Abwehr mission to Madrid in 1941.<br><br>During her interrogation and testimony, Chanel would claim Vaufreland&#x2019;s stories were &#x201c;fantasies.&#x201d; But French police and court documents tell another story: while French Resistance fighters were shooting Germans in the summer of 1941, Chanel was recruited as an agent by the Abwehr. Fifty pages of minute detail describe how Chanel and the trusted Abwehr agent F- 7117&#x2014; Baron Louis de Vaufreland Piscatory&#x2014; were recruited and linked together by German agent Lieutenant Hermann Niebuhr, alias Dr. Henri Neubauer, to travel together in the summer of 1941 on an espionage mission for German military intelligence. Vaufreland&#x2019;s job was to identify men and women who could be recruited, or coerced, into spying for Nazi Germany. Chanel, who knew Sir Samuel Hoare, the British ambassador to Spain, via her relations with the Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, was there to provide cover for Vaufreland&#x2019;s work.<br><br>It is doubtful that Judge Serre ever learned the extent and depth of Chanel&#x2019;s collaboration with Nazi offi cials. It is unlikely he saw the British secret intelligence report documenting what Count Joseph von Ledebur-Wicheln, an Abwehr agent and defector, told MI6 agents in 1944. In the fi le, Ledebur discussed how Chanel and Baron von Dincklage traveled to bombed- out Berlin in 1943 to offer Chanel&#x2019;s services as an agent to SS Reichsfu&#x308;hrer Heinrich Himmler. Ledebur also revealed that Chanel, after visiting Berlin, undertook a second mission to Madrid for SS general Walter Schellenberg, Himmler&#x2019;s chief of SS intelligence. Serre would never learn that Dincklage had been a German military intelligence officer since after WWI: Abwehr agent F- 8680.<br><br>It is also unlikely that Judge Serre ever discovered the depth of Chanel&#x2019;s collaboration with the Nazis in occupied Paris or that she was a paid agent of Walter Schellenberg. Nor did he know that Dincklage worked for the Abwehr and the Gestapo in France and for the Abwehr in Switzerland and, later, during the occupation of Paris.</p><h2>Law and Ethics in Educational Leadership (Allyn &amp; Bacon Educational Leadership)</h2><p><p> <i>Law and Ethics in Educational Leadership, 2/e</i> presents a real-world, problem-based approach that shows leadership candidates how to apply the legal knowledge, ethical dispositions, and other skills necessary to become successful school leaders.

The sweet characters are brought to life with adorable paintings by best-selling artist Lisa McCue.</p><p><p>PreS-K-Brown's exemplary tale of an inquisitive bunny exploring his world is just right for sharing. The young animal awakens to quiet morning sounds such as fluttering, chirping, "Cock Cock Cock-a-doodle Doo," and "bzzzzzzzz," and then identifies them, asking readers, "What was that?" Then the focus shifts from recognizing noises to making them, such as munching, scratching, and sneezing. As the sun goes down, "the little noises of the night" alert the protagonist that it is time "for little bunnies to be safe in their hole." McCue's brightly colored, detailed illustrations depicting a warm spring day from sunup to sundown are eye-catching and engaging; one can smell the lilacs, feel the sunshine, and thrill to the fireflies' glow at dusk. The affectionate paintings reveal the idyllic life of a carefree rabbit delighting in the woods and fields near his home, populated by numerous animals and insects.

"You have a hyperdrive mechanic here or don't you?" <br><br> The other eyed him a moment, then turned back to Karrde.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend's a little short on manners," he said. <br><br> "He makes up for it in ability," Karrde said, pulling a handful of high-denomination coins from his pocket and sorting ostentatiously through them.&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the understanding of schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some highly important business waiting for us on Svivren." <br><br> "Sure, I understand," the other said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"No offense, ah--?" <br><br> "Syndic Pandis Hart of the Sif-Uwana Council," Karrde identified himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my pilot, Captain Seoul."&nbsp;&nbsp;He chose one of the coins, held it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;"And we're rather in a hurry." <br><br> "Hey, no problem," the man grinned, jerking a thumb toward the port facilities building as he deftly took the coin from Karrde's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buzzy, go tell 'em they've got a customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush job." <br><br> His companion nodded silently and loped off toward the building. "Name's Fleck, Syndic," the man continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offhand, I'd say you're going to be stuck here for a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Got any plans?" <br><br> Karrde glanced pointedly around.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would there be any plans worth having?" <br><br> "Matter of fact, there would," Fleck said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fellow here runs a pretty neat safari out into the jungle--got a trip heading out first thing tomorrow morning, in fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever hear of Morodins?" <br><br> "I don't think so," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big game?" <br><br> "The biggest," Fleck assured him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant lizard-slug things, ten to twenty meters long.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make great wall or hallway trophies." His lip twitched sardonically.&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're not too fast or mean, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good way for a beginner to start." <br><br> "That's comforting to hear." Karrde looked at Tapper.&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think, Seoul?" <br><br> "Doesn't sound too dangerous, sir," Tapper said with just the right note of concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust you wouldn't be going alone?" <br><br> "Naw, there's four other hunters signed up," Fleck said. "And the boss always takes a couple of escorts along as guards. Safe as in a snuggy." <br><br> "I'd still recommend I accompany you, sir," Tapper persisted. "I used to be pretty good with a BlasTech A280." <br><br> "Let's find out first how much it costs to be as safe as in a snuggy," Karrde said dryly. <br><br> "Hardly anything," Fleck sniffed.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to a gentleman of your means.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only twelve thousand each." <br><br> Karrde smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A man of means doesn't stay there by throwing money away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen thousand for the both of us." <br><br> Fleck grinned.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hard bargainer, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it twenty." <br><br> "Experienced businessman," Karrde corrected.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make it seventeen." <br><br> The other's forehead wrinkled, then cleared.&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right. Seventeen it is." <br><br> "Very good," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"When do we leave?" <br><br> "Five-half tomorrow morning," Fleck said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just be here--I'll tell the boss you're coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget to bring the seventeen."&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed across the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can get outfitted over at that building over there, and get a room for the night in the hotel next door.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's, uh, nicer inside than it looks." <br><br> "One would hope so," Karrde agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust no one will be offended if we pass on the accommodations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outfitters will know what equipment we'll need?" <br><br> "Sure," Fleck nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like I said, the boss runs these safaris all the time." <br><br> "Very good," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, Seoul, let's go see what they have to offer."<br> Varonat's sun was beginning to settle down behind the jungle by the time Karrde and Tapper finally made it back to the <i>Uwana Buyer</i> with their purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope we gave them enough time," Tapper commented as they climbed up the ramp. <br><br> "I'm sure we did," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't take long for a professional to search a ship this size.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm not expecting Gamgalon to be employing amateurs." <br><br> Abruptly, Tapper touched Karrde's arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe he is," he said, dropping his voice. <br><br> Karrde frowned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard it: a muffled clank from the aft section of the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should we take a look?" Tapper murmured. <br><br> "It would look suspicious if we didn't," Karrde said, grimacing.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this whole thing fell apart through the incompetence of Gamgalon's own people...&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nice and easy." <br><br> Moving quietly, they headed down the central corridor to the engine room, hearing another clank as they reached the door. Karrde caught Tapper's eye, nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other nodded back, lowering his bundles to the deck and getting a grip on his blaster. Karrde touched the release, and the door slid open-- <br><br> The woman sitting on the floor beside the open access panel was young and attractive, with a cascade of red-gold hair tied back out of the way behind her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face was calm and controlled as she looked up at their abrupt entrance; beneath her jumpsuit, her figure was slim and athletic and nicely formed. <br><br> And in her hands were a hydrospanner and one of the power flux connectors from the <i>Uwana Buyer</i>'s hyperdrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I help you?" she asked coolly. <br><br> "I think you already are," Karrde said, the brief moment of surprise passing into relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamgalon's searchers had not, in fact, fouled up.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take it you're the hyperdrive mechanic." <br><br> "Cleverly deduced," she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celina Marniss.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have any problems?" <br><br> "Only with the hyperdrive," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, were you expecting me to?" <br><br> Celina shrugged, returning her attention to the power flux connector.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've known some men in my day who didn't think a woman could be decorative and competent at the same time." <br><br> "Personally, that's my favorite combination," Karrde told her. <br><br> She favored him with a look that was slightly amused, slightly strained-patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you're Syndic Hart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buzzy was most impressed with you." <br><br> "I'm ever so pleased," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't ask which way he was impressed."&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded at the access opening.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any idea yet what's wrong?" <br><br> "Well, for starters, your flux connectors are all about four degrees out of sync," Celina said, hefting the one in her hand. "They have to have been ignored for a long time to drift that far off." <br><br> "I see," Karrde said, his favorable first impression of this woman moving up another notch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chin had assured him that the flux connector gimmicking would take an average hyperdrive mechanic at least a day to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll have to speak to my maintenance man."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "Personally, I'd fire him," Celina said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll get these readjusted, then we can see what else is wrong."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "Good," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Buzzy may have mentioned, we're in something of a hurry."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "Funny way to go about it," she said, nodding toward the packages in the corridor behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gamgalon's safaris usually take upwards of four days."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "It's been my experience that a failed hyperdrive normally takes at least six to ten days to fix," Karrde said. <br><br> "Possibly another reason to fire your mechanic," Celina grunted.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm guessing I can do it in two or three."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "What makes you think we're going on a safari?" Tapper asked suspiciously. <br><br> "The packages, for a start," Celina told him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, you're obviously well-off, and you talked to Fleck.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's Gamgalon's chief come-up flector--does his job pretty well."&nbsp;&nbsp;She shrugged, turning her attention back to the flux connector. "Besides, what else is there to do around here?" <br><br> "Cleverly deduced," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're wrong about my personal wealth, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm merely chief purchasing agent for the Sif-Uwana Council."<br><br> "I'd call that a marginal distinction," Celina commented. "Certainly given the casual way Sif-Uwanis approach management and money."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "Really," Karrde said, his estimation moving up yet another notch.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would have bet heavily that there wouldn't be a single person on Varonat who'd ever even heard of Sif-Uwana, let alone know anything about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you ever been there?" <br><br> "Once," Celina said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a few years ago."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "Business or pleasure?" <br><br> "Business."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "What sort?" <br><br> She lifted an eyebrow at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't recall an invitation to play Questions Three with you, Syndic."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> "No offense intended," Karrde said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I merely find your presence here intriguing.&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem too skilled and well-traveled to be stuck out here in the backwater of the Ison Corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention your other obvious attributes."<br><br> He'd hoped to spark some reaction, to shake up that calm facade of hers a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she refused to turn to the lure.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I just like the peace and quiet," she countered.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I'm trying to raise a stake to get out."&nbsp;&nbsp;She locked eyes with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Green eyes, Karrde noted distantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;A very striking green, at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or maybe I'm hiding from something."This collection of 13 short stories by nine authors is an outgrowth from the Star Wars Adventure Journal and the Star Wars role-playing games.

But you may lack the tools and experiences to create the nurturing home you do want: a place where your children's physical and emotional needs are consistently met and where your children feel safe, valued, and loved.<p>In Healthy Parenting, Janet Woititz, a leading therapist, contrasts what happens in a healthy family with what happens in an unhealthy family to show just how your own upbringing influences the way you raise your children, and what you can do to make their upbringing better for them. For example: <br>-- In a healthy family the child is always loved even if the child's behavior is unacceptable. In an unhealthy family not only is the behavior criticized but the child is shamed as well.<br>-- In a healthy family the parent is teacher and guide. In an unhealthy family the child brings himself up the best he can.<br>-- In a healthy family there is structure, and reasonable limits are set. In an unhealthy family there is chaos or extreme rigidity.</p><p>As both therapist and parent, Janet Woititz can give you the guidance you missed in your childhood and help you avoid the mistakes your parents made.</p></p><p>In every family, parenting is filled with challenges as well as joys, and making the choice to become a parent means choosing both. But if you come from a troubled or dysfunctional family where you were emotionally or physically abused, you may wonder if you are really ready to parent children in a healthy way. The example set by your own parents taught you what you don&#39;t want for your children. How can you overcome this painful legacy and create what you do want: a stable, well-functioning home where your children feel safe, valued, and loved? The good news is that dysfunctional patterns and troubled lives do not have to be handed down to the next generation. Janet G. Woititz has counseled families for more than 20 years. Now, in Healthy Parenting, she draws upon her vast practical experience as a therapist, mother, and best-selling author to bring you the support and guidance you seek in creating a safe, nurturing environment for your children. Clear, direct, and practical, Healthy Parenting contrasts what happens in a healthy family with what happens in an unhealthy family, enabling you to identify the trouble spots in your own background and to overcome them in dealing with your own children. Effective parenting, Woititz contends, emerges from being able to recognize how your upbringing influences the way you raise your children, and knowing how to keep what works and discard what doesn&#39;t. Writing with clarity and compassion, she explores the vital challenges every parent faces - issues such as understanding boundaries, tolerating feelings, responding to a crisis, and learning to emphasize love rather than shame in teaching or disciplining a child. Throughout Healthy Parenting, frank and clarifying examples of common parenting dilemmas and triumphs bring these matters into brilliant focus. When adult children of troubled families learn what normal parenting is and what it is not, great burdens can be lifted, healing can take place, and loving, secure children can flourish in warm and stable homes. Whether you are just thinking about having children or have already become a parent, Janet G. Woititz offers the help and reassurance you need to make healthy parenting a part of your home.</p><h2>The New Ladies' Art Company Quick &amp; Easy Block Tool: 110 Quilt Blocks in 5 Sizes with Project Ideas � Packed with Hints, Tips &amp; Tricks � Simple Cutting Charts, Helpful Reference Tables</h2><p><p>Now in an easy-to-use reference guide size, this updated block tool includes 110 authentic blocks from America's first mail-order pattern company, the Ladies' Art Company.

The ancient mystery schools all taught their students the use of sound as a creative and healing force.</p> <p>Now, <em>Sacred Sounds </em>by Ted Andrews reveals how to tap into the magical and healing aspects of voice, resonance, and music. On a physical level, these techniques can be used to alleviate aches and pains, lower blood pressure, and balance hyperactivity in children. On a metaphysical level, they can be used to induce altered states of consciousness, open new levels of awareness, stimulate intuition, and increase creativity.</p> <p>Sounds can heal through their vibratory energy. To understand how this works you need to understand the power of vibratory energies within your body. This book will teach you about the chakras and how energy flows through them. You'll see what happens if that energy is blocked and learn how sound can be used to free the energy, a practice that can result in healing the physical body.</p> <p>To be even more specific, you'll learn the secrets of esoteric toning, healing method that involves vibrating certain vowel sounds. You will discover that each vowel has different pronunciations and different purposes. Thus, if you pronounce the vowel "a" as in "hay," you can help with problems of the chest and circulation. If you pronounce it as in "cat," you can heal respiration and mouth problems. And if you pronounce it as in "saw," it can aid digestive problems. All of this and more is fully explained in <em>Sacred Sounds.</em></p> <p>Perhaps the most famous users of sound were the bards. In <em>Sacred Sounds </em>you will learn their history, lore, training methods, healing techniques, and more.</p></p><p>At the heart of all lost spiritual and magical traditions was the teaching of the Power of the Word � the ability to use sound, music, and voice to affect changes in others and in yourself. The relaying of these teachings usually fell to individuals schooled in the natural and spiritual laws of the universe. Now you can learn these secrets in <i>Sacred Sounds</i> by Ted Andrews. <br> <br>These traditional teachers used the secret arts of sound to instruct, heal, and enlighten. They imbued their words with the power of the imagination and the power of music. Healing, song, and sorcery went hand-in-hand. The myths, stories, poems, and songs bridged the different worlds of life and the different modes of consciousness. And they kept the traditions and esoteric mysteries alive for the people. It is these mysteries and traditions you'll discover in <i>Sacred Sounds. <br> <br></i>The book explains how the music of different composers relates to the signs of the zodiac. With this information you will discover how to use this music to enhance the spirit or heal the body. You'll see how different sounds affect the health of different parts of the body, and understand how to use this to heal yourself or others. <br> <br>If you would like a powerful magical tool that requires nothing more than your voice, you need to get <i>Sacred Sounds. <br> <br></i><p><strong>Ted Andrews</strong>&nbsp;(1952-2009) was an award-winning author and deeply respected teacher in the metaphysical and spiritual fields.&nbsp;Through his seminars, symposiums, workshops, and lectures, he was committed to making esoteric material comprehensible and practical for everyone.</p> <p>Ted Andrew's many gifts included clairvoyancy, aura interpretation, past-life analysis, dreams interpretation, numerology, and Tarot. He wrote many books on these subjects, but is best known for his work with animal mysticism and for his bestselling <em>Animal Speak: The Spiritual &amp; Magical Powers of Creatures Great &amp; Small</em>. Certified in basic hypnosis and acupressure, Andrews was also involved in the study and use of herbs as an alternative path in health care, focusing strongly on esoteric forms of healing with sound, music, and voice. In addition to his interest in metaphysics, Ted was a trained pianist and often used the Celtic harp, bamboo flute, shaman rattles, Tibetan bells, Tibetan Singing Bowl, and quartz crystal bowls to create individual healing therapies and induce higher states of consciousness.</p> <p>Ted Andrews is the author of <em>The Healer's Manual</em>; <em>Animal-Speak</em>, <em>How to See &amp; Read the Aura</em>; <em>Enchantment of the Faerie Realm</em>; <em>Crystal Balls &amp; Crystal</em> Bowls; <em>How to Uncover Your Past Lives; How to Heal with Color; Sacred Sounds; Simplified Qabala Magic</em>; and many other New Age titles. He passed away on October 24, 2009.</p></p><h2>The ABCs of Success: The Essential Principles from America&#39;s Greatest Prosperity Teacher (Prosperity Gospel Series)</h2><p><b>An accessible guide to the principles of success by one of the most respected and sought-after motivational speakers of our time. In the tradition of Og Mandino and Zig Ziglar, this inspirational guide uses a wide variety of subjects, from &#x201c;Achievement&#x201d; to &#x201c;Worry,&#x201d; to bring clarity, information, and motivation to readers. </b><br><br> For millions of readers, Bob Proctor&#x2019;s name is synonymous with success. A former prot�g� of personal development pioneer Earl Nightingale, Proctor first built a wildly successful business career, and then an internationally successful speaking career, elaborating on the principles of Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Think and Grow Rich&nbsp;</i>and other classic success and prosperity texts. Proctor&#x2019;s position in the business motivation community equals that of Stephen Covey or Og Mandino. But as is not the case with those masters, his books have never been available to the general public&#x2014;until now!<br><br> In<b>&nbsp;</b><i>The ABCs of Success</i>&#x2014;the first trade book ever published by this master of motivation and prosperity&#x2014;Proctor goes beyond the simple laws of success and attraction, weighing in on sixty-seven different topics essential to all those who wish to make their dreams a reality, including persistence, winning, effectiveness, and vision. Organized in A-to-Z fashion and composed of brief essays that can be read over and over,&nbsp;<i>The ABCs of Success</i><b>&nbsp;</b>is an essential resource for anyone who wants the combined wisdom of a century of success thinking in a single, accessible volume.</p><p>A speaker, author, consultant, coach, and mentor,&nbsp;<b>Bob Proctor</b>&nbsp;was already a legendary figure in the world of personal development long before his appearance in the hit film&nbsp;<i>The Secret</i>. For more than forty years, Proctor has been one of the biggest names in prosperity and personal development, delivering talks around the world that motivate people to achieve success and prosperity. Through his work with the Proctor Gallagher Institute, which he cofounded, he has transformed countless lives with his message of prosperity.<p></p><p>Foreword</p><p>In 2006, at a seminar in Vancouver, Washington, a man I&#x2019;d never met, seen, or heard of before stepped onto a stage in front of me, began speaking, and proceeded to change the course of my life forever.</p><p>That man&#x2019;s name was Bob Proctor. And the day I spent in his audience all those years ago, soaking up his energy and wisdom and jotting down notes like crazy, marked the beginning of a journey I had never imagined myself taking, toward a future I had never envisioned&#x2014;though I came to realize it was the future I had been destined for all along.</p><p>As I would quickly learn, I wasn&#x2019;t the only one who&#x2019;d had such an experience after meeting him. In fact, I was one of millions.</p><p>But Bob Proctor didn&#x2019;t just help facilitate my new future; he became an essential part of it. You see, I made a sudden and absolute decision at that seminar: I decided that one day, I was going to work with this incredible man. Not just work with him, but become a member of his inner circle of advisers.</p><p>Soon after that seminar, I walked away from a thriving law practice and booming, lucrative career to do exactly that. I have never looked back.</p><p>Today, as his business partner, his collaborator, and&#x2014;the role I most cherish&#x2014;his friend, I am reminded on a day-to-day, sometimes minute-to-minute basis, of exactly why Bob Proctor is one of the most respected, listened-to, and beloved people on this planet.</p><p>&#x201c;How does he do it?&#x201d; Walk through the crowd at a Bob Proctor event (and there&#x2019;s always a crowd) and you&#x2019;ll hear that question a lot. How does he have so much energy? How does he manage to do so much, to connect with so many, to always seem as excited and passionate about the information he&#x2019;s presenting as if he has just discovered it for the first time?</p><p>Having now spent countless hours with him, I can tell you that there&#x2019;s no &#x201c;seem&#x201d; about Bob&#x2019;s passion or belief. It&#x2019;s 100 percent real, every time.</p><p>Everything Bob does comes from a place of absolute genuineness, conviction, and generosity. He is a living testament to the truth and effectiveness of everything he teaches. He knows, from the most powerful, indelible sort of personal experience, that with the right combination of faith, knowledge, and action, anything&#x2014;<i>anything</i>&#x2014;is possible, for anyone. He is consistently awed by the magnificence of this truth, and he&#x2019;s on a mission, in every moment of his life, to awaken as many people to it as he possibly can.</p><p>And if it also &#x201c;seems&#x201d; as if he&#x2019;s plugged in to some sort of cosmic energy source in pursuit of this mission, he&#x2019;ll be the first one to tell you that he absolutely is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that there&#x2019;s an open outlet for anyone who wants to join him!</p><p>Yet there remains something about Bob Proctor that defies definition or categorization&#x2014;something that can&#x2019;t be explained by his past, his experiences, or his accomplishments; something remarkably rare and precious. Many know the truth. Many live the truth. But very few are able to make the truth known and livable to others. He IS. As one gentleman at a recent event so perfectly put it, &#x201c;You could hear the same thing a hundred times from a hundred great people. But somehow, when Bob says it, you get it. You <i>believe</i> it.&#x201d;</p><p>Of the many wonderful gifts he possesses, I believe this one is his greatest. Truly, there is no one else in the world quite like Bob Proctor.</p><p>The writings we&#x2019;ve brought together in this collection represent Bob at his very best. As you read them, you&#x2019;ll witness his amazing ability to distill the most complex questions and challenging concepts down to something simple, clear, and completely understandable: his extraordinary gift for seeing and articulating the profundity in ordinary occurrences and the magic in everyday moments, and his uncanny knack for saying exactly the right thing, at precisely the right moment and in just the right way, to flip the switch&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to make it all suddenly click.</p><p>This is what Bob Proctor did and continues to do for me. It&#x2019;s what he has done for so, so many people all over the world. It&#x2019;s what he will do for you, too, the moment you let him into your life.</p><p>Turn the page, and start right now.

With Awareness, Acceptance, and Alteration comes Achievement.</p><p>First, you must become Aware of the primary cause of the results you are getting. The truth is not always in the appearance of things. Your results are never caused by something outside of yourself; results are always an inside job. Your results are a physical or outward expression of the inner conditioning in your subconscious mind.</p><p>Your behavior is causing your results&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and your conditioning is causing your behavior.</p><p>The second A is Acceptance. You must accept responsibility for your results. When you accept full responsibility for your own results, you will make the necessary decisions to alter them.</p><p>Acceptance of this truth is always the preamble to a magnificent future.</p><p>When you accept your subconscious conditioning as the cause of your results, you will be ready for the third A&#x2014;Alteration. You will decide to alter the conditioning in your subconscious mind, conditioning that is both genetic and environmental. You and your results are actually the product of someone else&#x2019;s habitual way of thinking. To make the necessary alterations in this area not only takes time, it takes a respectable amount of study and discipline, but it&#x2019;s worth it.</p><p>It is well worth every penny and every speck of energy you invest in learning how to alter your old conditioning.</p><p>This simple process will permit you to ACHIEVE whatever goal you set.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s review it. Become Aware of the cause of your results. Accept responsibility for your results. Alter your conditioned subconscious mind. Achieve any goal you set.</p><p>Straight As&#x2014;aim for them!</p><p>Nothing stops the man who desires to achieve. Every obstacle is simply a course to develop his achievement muscle. It&#x2019;s a strengthening of his powers of accomplishment.</p><p>I attempt an arduous task; but there is no worth in that which is not a difficult achievement.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ACTION</p><p>The personal association I had with Earl Nightingale was a great education, but I could never estimate the effect his recorded messages have had on my life.</p><p>One of those messages was titled &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Good.&#x201d; I listened to it so often, I could almost repeat it verbatim. On that record, he shared a fable about the devil having a sale that is most interesting. Like most old fables, it has a moral well worth thinking about.</p><p>The story goes that Satan was having a sale of his wares. There on display, and offered for sale, were the rapier of jealousy, the dagger of fear, and the strangling noose of hatred, each with its own high price.</p><p>But standing alone on a purple pedestal was a worn and battered wedge. This was the devil&#x2019;s most prized possession, for with it alone he could stay in business. It was not for sale. It was the wedge of discouragement.</p><p>Why do you suppose the devil valued so highly, and actually would not sell, the worn and battered wedge of discouragement? Makes you think, doesn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>He prized discouragement because of its enfeebling, demoralizing effect. Hatred, fear, or jealousy may lead immature people to act unwisely, to fight, or to run. But at least they act.</p><p>Discouragement, on the other hand, hurts people more than any of these. It causes them to sit down, pity themselves, and do nothing.</p><p>Now, this doesn&#x2019;t have to happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, it all too frequently does. Not until we realize that discouragement is often a form of self-pity do we begin to take stock of ourselves and our predicament and decide to act&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to do something that will take us out of the unpleasant situation.</p><p>The answer to discouragement, then, is intelligent action. Get rid of discouragement before it gets rid of you. The devil might not survive without this priceless wedge, but you can.</p><p>There are risks and costs to action. But they are far less than the long-range risks of comfortable inaction.</p><p>Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.</p><p>Doubt, of whatever kind, can be ended by action alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Successful living consists of knowing and being. When the two are separated, there is nothing but frustration and failure.</p><p>To know all about love without loving can be disastrous. In the same way, knowing all about the right way to live and not acting on what you know, on a daily basis, can prove to be very destructive for anyone.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the self-help books on our bestseller lists deal with positive thinking, without much concern for translating it consciously into experience. We are supplied with maps to Nirvana but cannot locate the vehicle to get us there.</p><p>If positive thinking alone resulted in successful living, 95 percent of our population would reside on Easy Street. All of our preachers and teachers would be physical examples of health, wealth, and well-being. Unfortunately, many are physical contradictions to what they tell us.</p><p>Half-truths are more elusive than lies. Positive thinking as a medium to the good life is just that: a half-truth.</p><p>Positive thinking alone does not deliver, it does not fulfill. In fact, it frustrates, because it is not in harmony with what we do. Thinking positively about music will not make you a musician. Only singing and playing a musical instrument will bring you fulfillment.</p><p>The power of positive thought lies in its being expressed in a positive act. The thought of love finds its fulfillment in loving. Thoughts of joy find their power in laughter. Faith without action is dead.</p><p>Nothing can result so negatively as thinking positively without the action that fulfills that thinking.</p><p>Schools should award diplomas for what we do rather than what we know. Nothing is more powerful than a positive thought joined with positive action.</p><p>The ancestor of every action is a thought.</p><p>Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.</p><p>Action is the real measure of intelligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Winners are wide awake; they are alive. Every day you will find them in the marketplace making things happen. The real winners are not just dreamers. Although they have dreams, they are doers: They realize their dreams. They are the bell ringers, always attempting to wake others up to the numerous opportunities life offers.</p><p>If you want to cash in on the rewards life has to offer, follow the winners. Do as they do, and ultimately you will become the winner you are capable of being.</p><p>If you are not presently living the way you really want to live, don&#x2019;t feel bad about it or have any regrets about the past. Today can be the beginning of a new life. Just as you turn the page on the calendar to reveal a new day or month, mentally you can do that with your life.</p><p>Listen to the winners. They want to help you. Every day they are offering you membership in their club.</p><p>The greatest reward a winner can receive is to see someone who has been in a deep psychological sleep wake up and grab that brass ring. The winners are openly rewarded for the help they provide.</p><p>They are easy to spot; they very rarely hide. They drive nice vehicles, wear good clothes, live in beautiful homes, take interesting vacations, have happy families, and live in healthy bodies. They have dynamic, creative personalities and are almost always involved in executing a big idea.</p><p>Winners do not permit the criticism of the losers to distract or slow them down.</p><p>They are too busy turning their dreams into reality and helping others do the same thing.</p><p>Winning is not a sometime thing; it&#x2019;s an all the time thing. You don&#x2019;t win once in a while, you don&#x2019;t do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.</p><p>When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don&#x2019;t adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.</p><p>Do you want to know who you are? Don&#x2019;t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>AMBITION</p><p>Do you ever think of yourself as a natural goal achiever? If you don&#x2019;t, you should, because you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a natural goal achiever.</p><p>The moment the first breath of life filled your lungs you set out pursuing goals. You are innately programmed to improve the quality of your life. Each of your first early achievements brought with them tremendous satisfaction, along with great pride and joy.</p><p>Your first goal was to get something to eat, and when have you ever seen anyone more satisfied than a baby who has just been fed? Or where have you seen greater pride and joy than on the face of a new mother nursing her baby?</p><p>How about those other first early goals&#x2014;to crawl, to talk, or to walk? Think of the satisfaction, pride, and joy that came with that first word or first step. The satisfaction with the first word or step soon wears off and dissatisfaction sets in. You want to put words together, steps together. They became goals and as you accomplished them, more satisfaction, pride, and joy followed, but so did the feeling of dissatisfaction. You wanted to accomplish more, do greater things.</p><p>You naturally want to experience life and experience it in abundance. You not only should, you can have the things you want&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;and you will have them if you rekindle that early spirit that caused you to pursue and achieve those first goals.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many of us were told at an early stage that we should be satisfied with what we had. Goals and their importance were lost.</p><p>You should never be satisfied. Happy, but not satisfied. Dissatisfaction is a creative state. It took you out of the cave and put you into the condominium. It gave you the wheel, the fax, and the furnace. Dissatisfaction gave you and me a lifestyle that is the envy of the world.</p><p>Develop a healthy dissatisfaction with your life. Set new goals&#x2014;big, exciting goals. Then, set out to achieve them with the same enthusiasm you knew and used as a baby.</p><p>That is called living. Everything else is dying.</p><p>Big results require big ambitions.</p><p>Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.</p><p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p><p>&#x2014;ALFRED LORD TENNYSON</p><p></p><p></p><p>ATTITUDE</p><p>Nature gave a wonderful gift to most of her little creatures&#x2014;a gift we call &#x201c;protective coloring&#x201d;&#x2014;so that the deer blends into the forest, the fish into the stream, and the bi...</p></p><h2>Misty Shadows Of Hope: 1870 (The Bregdan Chronicles)</h2><p><p><em><strong>Misty Shadows Of Hope</strong></em>&nbsp;is the 14th book in the Bregdan Chronicles historical fiction series.

She is passionate about bringing history to life through historical fiction. Since she is amazingly healthy, that could be for a very long time! She doesn&#x2019;t like stories to end any more than you do. This one won't end for a very long time!</p><p><em><strong>Review:</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a follower of this series, I was intrigued when author Ginny broached the subject several times about Granite's age. Before this book was released I wondered how much time Carrie's best friend had left as a character. Although still unanswered, I see we were traveling along the same thread. I find the whole KKK issue interesting and appalling at the same time. Having lived through the troublesome 60s and beyond, I am surprised that we as a nation and as a society are no further along in our racial development than what's portrayed in the 1800s. Makes my heart ache. As always I recommend this series. It's wholesome, I will assume mostly historically accurate, and it makes a reader think about their biases and family indoctrination relating to those biases. Thank you Ginny Dye for being such a positive guide during this period of history.<br><br>Review:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginny, thank you. You are writing a series I don't think exists except for you. I fell in love with learning the truths about slavery and the civil war through historical novels. They stick with me more than ready a straight history book because I can emotionally connect with the characters.<br><br>Of all the series and books I've read, this is the only series I know of that continues beyond the end of the war and into the real issues of reconstruction. I don't believe enough attention is given to this pivotal point in our history.

The texts and translations are reproduced as they appear in Loeb volumes.<br>The Loeb Classical Library� is the only existing series of books which, through original text and facing English translation, gives access to all that is important in Greek and Latin literature. <i>A Loeb Classical Library Reader</i> offers a unique sampling of this treasure trove. In these pages you will find:<br>Odysseus tricking the Cyclops in order to escape from the giant&#x2019;s cave; Zeus creating the first woman, Pandora, cause of mortals&#x2019; hardships ever after; the Athenian general Nicias dissuading his countrymen from invading Sicily; Socrates, condemned to die, saying farewell; a description of Herod&#x2019;s fortified palace at Masada; Cicero&#x2019;s thoughts on what we owe our fellow men; Livy&#x2019;s description of the rape of the Sabine women; Manilius on the signs of the zodiac; and Pliny&#x2019;s observation of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE.<br>Here you can enjoy looking in on people, real and imaginary, who figure prominently in ancient history, and on notable events. Here, too, you can relish classical poetry and comedy, and get a taste of the ideas characteristic of the splendid culture to which we are heir.</p><p>A complete list of the works available in the Loeb Classical Library is available at www.hup.harvard.edu/loeb.&#x201c;Here you will find old friends; Odysseus planning to dangle underneath a ram as he escapes the Cyclops or Plato (this translation from 1914) reporting Socrates' last words in an Athenian jail hours before the 'corrupter of the youth' drinks hemlock at the state's behest... Although the <i>Reader</i>&#x2015;like all anthologies (literally a gathering of flowers, but of course only a scoopful of petals)&#x2015;is frustrating (the excerpts stop just as you are hooked, so we never hear Socrates delivering his mnemonic line 'it is time to depart, for me to die, for you to live; which of us takes the better course, god only knows') it does carry cogent gobbets.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bettany Hughes</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A small book that has been my companion on every train and bus journey for the past two weeks...

Includes exercises, questions, and self-tests designed to help readers put things into perspective and keep the little things from taking over their lives.</p><p>Sure, Richard Carlson's bestselling <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff...</i> contains plenty of sensible advice, but it's not always easy to follow. Enter this intriguing workbook with its universal appeal: it's aimed at anyone interested in reducing stress and improving their relationships. Designed to help you put the many peace-promoting, "just let it go" principles of <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</i> into active practice, it's bursting with fun quizzes, checklists, self-tests, questions, and activities. If this doesn't instruct and inspire you to make concrete personality and life improvements, there's nothing much that will!<p> In one exercise, "<i>Lower</i> Your Tolerance to Stress," Carlson suggests that we'd be better off if we didn't brag about how much stress we can handle. People who do brag about their stress tolerance, he says, are usually stressed out all the time. To help you reduce your tolerance, he lists 20 signs of stress (among them: allergies, anxiety, depression, frequent headaches, and restlessness) and asks you to put a check mark next to the ones you've experienced. The next time you feel any of these symptoms, he says, you should analyze and write down how you might change your behavior in order to alleviate or prevent these problems in the future. In another exercise, "Create 'Patience Practice Periods,'" he first asks you to analyze your level of patience (Do you drive above the speed limit? Grow furious when stuck in voice mail mazes? Feel like everyone else at the mall walks too slowly and gets in your way?). He then gives a series of hypothetical patience-killing situations--a long line at the grocery store, or slow, tricky traffic--and leaves space for you to write about how these situations would make you react. </p><p> Some exercises are true/false, some are of the never/sometimes/often/always variety, while others require thoughtful written responses. A few are by nature harder to handle than others ("Imagine Yourself at Your Own Funeral"), so the workbook therefore shouldn't be devoured in one sitting, but dipped into a bit at a time. This is a fine way to nurture the much-underrated concepts of empathy, forgiveness, tolerance, and kindness.</p><strong>Richard Carlson</strong>, Ph.D., was the author of the bestselling <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em> series.

One result of these efforts was a series of novels that became counterculture bibles that remain widely influential today. Another was a body of evocative spiritual poetry. Published for the first time in English, these vivid, probing short works reflect deeply on the challenges of life and provide a spiritual solace that transcends specific denominational&nbsp;hymns, prayers, and rituals.<br> <i><br>The Seasons of the Soul </i>offers valuable guidance in poetic form for those longing for a more meaningful life, seeking a sense of homecoming in nature, in each stage of life, in a renewed relationship with the divine. Extensive quotations from his prose introduce each theme addressed in the book: love, imagination, nature, the divine, and the passage of time. A foreword by Andrew Harvey reintroduces us to a figure about whom some may have believed&nbsp;everything had already been said. Thoughtful commentary throughout from translator Ludwig Max Fischer helps readers understand the poems within the context of Hesse&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s novels include <i>Demian, Siddhartha, Steppenwolf, </i>and <i>The Glass Bead Game. </i>The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, he died in 1962 at age 85. Ludwig Max<i> </i>Fischer, PhD, has been professor of<i> </i>German and comparative mythology<i> </i>for over forty years, most recently at Willamette University<i> </i>in Salem, Oregon.&#x201c;These vital, essential poems could not possibly be appearing at a more crucial time in the history of our Western culture.... Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s poetry is as eye-opening and as life-giving as his most famous novels. It offers the heartfelt, infinitely timely guidance of someone who lived at every step what he wrote and who leads his readers back to the simplicity of &#x2018;what we knew in the beginning.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Peter Kingsley, author of <i>Reality</i> and <i>A Story Waiting to Pierce You: Mongolia, Tibet and the Destiny of the Western World<br><br></i>&#x201c;Ludwig Fischer proves wrong all who claim that &#x2018;poetry is what gets lost in translation.&#x2019; His English versions of sixty-eight poems by Hermann Hesse ring as if they had been first conceived in English. In addition to that, Fischer&#x2019;s sensitive introductions to these poems make this book a rare treasure. Hesse ... struggled with the dark side of life and grew strong. Therefore his poems&#x2014;now at last in English&#x2014;can help us find strength to come fully alive.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Brother David Steindl-Rast, OSB, author of <i>Deeper Than Words: Living the Apostles' Creed </i>and <i>Gratefulness, The Heart of Prayer: An Approach to Life in Fullness</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;It is in his poems that you meet most intimately Hesse the man in all his emotional intensity, sometimes scalding self-knowledge, and fierce spiritual struggle, and so experience most completely the inner turmoil and revelations that led to his becoming<br> one of the philosopher-sages of our tumultuous transition.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;from the foreword by Andrew Harvey, author of <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i> and <i>Heart Yoga: The Sacred Marriage of Yoga and Mysticism</i><br><br>"This collection of poetry reveals his inner journey, one that is often filled with inner turmoil and despairing, and yet unwavering in [Hesse's] devotion toward an intimacy with self/spirit. Commentary from the scholar and translator Ludwig Max Fischer enriches our understanding of Hesse's life context from which the poems were born." &#x2014; New Consciousness Review<br><br>"The Seasons of the Soul offers valuable guidance in poetic form for those longing for a more meaningful life, seeking a sense of homecoming in nature, in each stage of life, in a renewed relationship with the divine." &#x2014; Vitality Magazine<br><br>"A thoughtful work of literature, The Seasons of the Soul is a strong pick for any world literary studies and poetry collection." &#x2014; Midwest Book Review</p><h2>The 12th Man: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance</h2><p><b>A stunning story of heroism and survival during World War II. The book that inspired the international film of the same name. &#x201c;A must-read .... Intrigue, suspense, and adventure."&#x2014;<i>The Norwegian American</i></b><br><br>"I remember reading <i>We Die Alone</i> in 1970 and I could never forget it. Then when we went to Norway to do a docudrama, people told us again and again that certain parts were pure fiction. Since I was a Norwegian that was not good enough; I had to find the truth. I sincerely believe we did,&#x201d; writes author Astrid Karlsen Scott.<br><br><i>The 12th Man</i> is the true story of Jan Baalsrud, whose struggle to escape the Gestapo and survive in Nazi-occupied Norway has inspired the international film of the same name. In late March 1943, in the midst of WWII, four Norwegian saboteurs arrived in northern Norway on a fishing cutter and set anchor in Toftefjord to establish a base for their operations. However, they were betrayed, and a German boat attacked the cutter, creating a battlefield and spiraling Jan Baalsrud into the adventure of his life.<br><br>The only survivor and wounded, Baalsrud begins a perilous journey to freedom, swimming icy fjords, climbing snow-covered peaks, enduring snowstorms, and getting caught in a monstrous avalanche. Suffering from snow blindness and frostbite, more than sixty people of the Troms District risk their lives to help Baalsrud to freedom. Meticulously researched for more than five years,<br><br>Karlsen Scott and Haug bring forth the truth behind this captivating, edge-of-your-seat, real-life survival story.</p><p><b>Astrid Karlsen Scott</b> first became acquainted with Jan Baalsrud&#x2019;s story in 1970. In 1997, she began serious investigation of the details of the story. Scott has returned to Norway eight times in a period of three years in her efforts to find the truth. She met Dr. Tore Haug in 1997; they decided to combine their work and made many joint and separate trips to the Troms District to research this book. To gain a complete understanding of this magnificent drama, the coauthors explored the sites where the events took place, hiking up mountains and examining landmarks. Scott and Dr. Haug also met and interviewed all the survivors who helped Jan or who were indirectly involved and had knowledge of his story. Astrid, a native of Norway, is internationally known for her books on Norwegian culture. Her award-winning video, Christmas in Norway, has been shown on television in the United States and in Europe. She is also president of Nordic Adventure, a company dedicated to the promotion of Norwegian culture. She and her husband, Melvin McCabe Scott, Jr., live in Olympia, Washington. They have three children and thirteen grandchildren.<br><br><b>Dr. Tore Haug</b> is a second cousin of Jan Baalsrud. He has been fascinated with Baalsrud's escape story since meeting Jan once as a boy in 1956. In 1995, after much research, he traveled with his family to the Troms District in northern Norway to further investigate Jan&#x2019;s story. He found many people whose efforts on Jan&#x2019;s behalf had not been acknowledged in previous accounts. Dr. Haug wanted to accurately tell the entire story of Jan and his incredible escape from the Gestapo, and of the undaunted courage of his many benefactors. Today, he is the person who knows the story better than anyone else in Norway. Haug is an M.D., a specialized general practitioner with a private practice in Norway. He studied and received his medical degree from Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. He has practiced medicine in Germany and Norway, and is fluent in German, Norwegian, and English. In 1976, Dr. Haug obtained his professional pilot&#x2019;s license in the United States and Norway and flew as an executive pilot for five years. He and his wife, Wenche, live in Jessheim, Norway, with their daughter, Carolin.&#x201c;This story is a natural treasure for Norway. It&#x2019;s a great survival story; it sheds light on all the people who helped Baalsrud. They were the people in the country, fishermen and grandmothers who proved to be heroes themselves."&#x2014;Director Harald Zwart <br><br> "This is a must-read book for anyone who enjoys reading true historical, well-researched stories of intrigue, suspense, and adventure." <i>The Norwegian American</i><br><br>"My colleagues and I have read [<i>The 12th Man</i>] with great interest...we have been impressed with the way [the authors] make this truly remarkable story come alive, focusing not only on Jan Baalsrud, but showing the quiet courage and determination of his many helpers." Jan Gerhard Lassen, Norwegian Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br><br>"A welcome and much appreciated contribution to the growing library of World War II memoirs and eye-witness accounts.

Even by the lofty standards of the SAS and Special Forces, one has to look far to find anyone who can match his record of resilience and valor in the face of such daunting odds and with resources so paltry. In the fight he showed himself to be a military maestro. A bush-lore genius, blessed with uncanny instincts and an unbridled determination to close with the enemy, he had no peers as a combat-tracker (and there was plenty of competition). But the Rhodesian theater was a fluid and volatile one in which he performed in almost every imaginable fighting role; as an airborne shock-trooper leading camp attacks, long range reconnaissance operator, covert urban operator, sniper, saboteur, seek-and-strike expert, and in the final stages as a key figure in mobilizing an allied army in neighboring Mozambique. <br><br>After 12 years in the cauldron of war his cause slipped from beneath him, however, and Rhodesia gave way to Zimbabwe. When the guns went quiet Watt had won all his battles but lost the war. In this fascinating work we learn that in his twilight years he is now concerned with saving wildlife on a continent where they are in continued danger, devoting himself to both the fauna and African people he has cared so deeply about.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Acknowledgments<br>Author&#x2019;s Note<br>A Brief History of Rhodesia<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br>Rebellion � Darrell Watt � The wind of change 19<br><br>CHAPTER 2 <br>Formation of the SAS � Harold Wilson and the Soviets � The first farm attack � Recruit Watt �Robinson on SAS selection<br><br>CHAPTER 3<br>First blood � The two-toed tribe � Watt&#x2019;s first action � Operation Cauldron � Hadebe � Into Mozambique �Into Zambia � Smith settles � Mbuya Nehanda<br><br>CHAPTER 4<br>The end of the beginning � Hawkesworth � Macombe � Andy Chait � Rhodesians on top � Coup in Portugal �D�tente � Herbert Chitepo<br><br>CHAPTER 5<br>The Victoria Falls d�b�cle � Exodus from the SAS � Machipanda � Life on the &#x2018;front&#x2019; � A &#x2018;Kiwi&#x2019; entry �The &#x2018;Winged Stagger&#x2019;<br><br>CHAPTER 6<br>Mozambique declares war � Enter Henry Kissinger �Water warriors<br><br>CHAPTER 7<br>Rude awakenings � Renamo is born � The south-east heats up � Shooting the messenger � Operation Mardon � Carter wins, Rhodesia loses � Frustration �Mine everything � Walking on water<br><br>CHAPTER 8<br>Going for broke � Do or die � The attack � Watt shot<br><br>CHAPTER 9<br>The madness continues � Watt to Botswana � Domestic problems � Camp on the Zambezi � Internal settlement � Renamo rises � Murder most foul � Back to Tembu� � The stay-behind party <br><br>CHAPTER 10<br>Monkey business � &#x2018;Tiny&#x2019; Rowland � Viscount Hunyani � The deafening silence<br><br>CHAPTER 11<br>Chris Dixon � Para attack � Ambush<br><br>CHAPTER 12<br>Privateers � Richard Stannard � Innocents die � Lights out<br><br>CHAPTER 13<br>Another Viscount downed � Watt finds the killers � Stannard back to Chimoio � Recce on a ZIPRA camp � Bishop Muzorewa wins power<br><br>CHAPTER 14<br>Combat tracking at speed � More farmers murdered � The &#x2018;Iron Lady&#x2019; folds � Scheepers back in the fray<br><br>CHAPTER 15<br>Chopper down � Yankee Section � Operation Bumper � Monte Xiluvo � The Russians are coming<br><br>CHAPTER 16<br>A leader dies � Life with Luke � A mystery death at Lancaster House<br><br>CHAPTER 17<br>Bust the bridges � A big surprise � Time to say goodbye<br><br>CHAPTER 18<br>Ceasefire � More attempts to kill Mugabe � Walls folds � The order that never came � A farewell to arms<br><br>Appendix A The Unilateral Declaration of Independence<br>Appendix B SAS Roll of Honour<br><br>Endnotes <br>Bibliography <br></p><p>Hannes Wessels was born in 1956 in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) but grew up in Umtali on the Mozambican border. As a boy, holidays were spent with Game Department rangers; time on safari in Mozambique with the late Wally Johnson was a big influence on him. Wessels also grew to know Robert Ruark whose love of Africa, its people, politics and the written word left a lasting impression. He saw action in the Rhodesian bush war before acquiring a law degree which he chose not to use. He has hunted big game in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania in a 20-year career. In 1994 he was severely gored by a wounded buffalo which almost cost him his life. While no longer directly involved in hunting, he is part-owner of a lodge and game ranch in Zambia on the Zambezi and remains keenly interested in all matters relating to African wildlife and conservation. He has published Strange Tales from Africa in the USA, a collection of anecdotes from his hunting days. He is also a syndicated writer for Outdoor Life in the United States and is currently writing a history on the Rhodesian SAS. He is married to Mandy and has two daughters, Hope and Jana, and lives in Darling in the Western Cape of South Africa."What we saw on the BBC TV news while all this was going on was the various meetings between Harold Wilson, his ministers and Ian Smith, who had declared independence for Rhodesia. We were unaware of what was actually taking place in the country... Hannes Wessels redresses the balance with an amazing tale of daring and courage." (<i>Books Monthly</i>)<br><br>"A Handful of Hard Men is, first and foremost, an account of the actions of Rhodesian SAS throughout the brief life of that republic; Wessels has a talent for bringing the lengthy list of battles and skirmishes to life. However, his account regularly connects the events in southern Africa to the larger context, and the perceptive reader understands that the war was not lost on the battlefield: iIs end was the result of treachery in Washington, D.C. and London, as well as in New York at the United Nations and even within the halls of government in Salisbury, Rhodesia, where (it is alleged) agents of influence played a role in undermining the nation. The account of the SAS ends with a fading away; deprived of the opportunity to assassinate Robert Mugabe before he could assume control of the nation and transform it into the horrific slaughterhouse called Zimbabwe, the brave men of the SAS stood down. They did their duty; the loss of Rhodesia was a tragedy willed by forces beyond their control.

Watt won all his battles but eventually, thanks to Lord Carrington and gang, lost the war. For 12 long years in the cauldron of war Captain Watt never lost a battle, exhibiting Spartan-like bravery and better than Spartan-like ingenuity in combating far, far superior forces.

Here, with a team of scientists, he found that many psychological problems can be traced to biochemical imbalances in the body. With these patients, he achieved unprecedented success in treating a wide range of mental problems by adjusting diet and providing specific nutritional supplements for those conditions where deficiences exist. This book documents his approach. <br>Each year, thousands of people are diagnosed as schizophrenic; many more suffer from depression, anxiety, and phobias. <br><br>Dr. Pfeiffer's methods of treatment presented in <i>Nutrition and Mental Illness</i> are a valuable adjunct to traditional therapies, and can bring hope of real wellness to many of those who suffer.</p><p>Carl C. Pfeiffer Ph.D., M.D. was the Director of the Brain Bio Center in Princeton, New Jersey.<b>That Odd Mary Magdalene<br></b> <br>It seems that even among Jesus&#x2019; disciples, Mary played a privileged role. Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Victorian Architectural Details: Designs for Over 700 Stairs, Mantels, Doors, Windows, Cornices, Porches, and Other Decorative Elements (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>Originally published over 130 years ago by one of America's leading architectural firms, this volume provided prospective homeowners and other customers with a wide range of design alternatives.

Those features to which we are most attracted are often signals of fertility and fecundity. When seen in the context of a Darwinian struggle for survival, our sometimes extreme attempts to attain beauty&#x2014;both to become beautiful ourselves and to acquire an attractive partner&#x2014;suddenly become much more understandable. Moreover, if we understand how the desire for beauty is innate, then we can begin to work in our own interests, and not just the interests of our genetic tendencies.</p><p>In the latter part of the 20th century, the adage "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" has evolved far beyond its original intent as an admonition against false vanity to become a cultural manifesto used to explain phenomena as diverse as the art of Andy Warhol and the rise of a multi-billion-dollar cosmetics industry. But is there something more to human reaction to beauty than a conditioned response to social cues? Yes, says Harvard Medical School psychologist Nancy Etcoff. <i>Survival of the Prettiest</i> argues persuasively that looking good has survival value, and that sensitivity to beauty is a biological adaptation governed by brain circuits shaped by natural selection.<p> Etcoff synthesizes a fascinating array of scientific research and cultural analysis in support of her thesis. Psychologists find that babies stare significantly longer at the faces adults find appealing, while the mothers of "attractive" babies display more intense bonding behaviors. The symmetrical face of average proportions may have become the optimal design because of evolutionary pressures operating against population extremes. Gentlemen may prefer blondes not so much for their hair color as for the fairness of their skin--which makes it easier to detect the flush of sexual excitement. And high heels accentuate a woman's breasts and buttocks, signaling fertility. Is beauty programmed into our brain circuits as a proxy for health and youth? In marked contrast to other writers like Naomi Wolf (<i>The Beauty Myth</i>), Etcoff argues that it is, noting, "Rather than denigrate one source of women's power, it would seem far more useful for feminists to attempt to elevate all sources of women's power." <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i></p>ocative, witty, and thoroughly researched inquiry into what we find beautiful and why, Nancy Etcoff skewers one of our culture's most enduring myths, that the pursuit of beauty is a learned behavior.

She deftly weaves the harrowing history of the region and captures the effects of political upheaval on a personal level.</b><br><br>An extraordinary journey into the past and present of the lands east of Poland and west of Russia&#x2014;an area defined throughout its history by colliding empires. Traveling from the former Soviet naval center of Kaliningrad on the Baltic to the Black Sea port of Odessa, Anne Applebaum encounters a rich range of competing cultures, religions, and national aspirations. <br> &nbsp;<br> In reasserting their heritage, the inhabitants of the borderlands attempt to build a future grounded in their fractured ancestral legacies. In the process, neighbors unearth old conflicts, devote themselves to recovering lost culture, and piece together competing legends to create a new tradition. Rich in surprising encounters and vivid characters, <i>Between East and West</i> brilliantly illuminates the soul of the borderlands and the shaping power of the past.</p><p>Anne Applebaum&nbsp;is a columnist for&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>&nbsp;and the author of several history books, including G<i>ulag</i>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, and&nbsp;<i>Iron Curtain,&nbsp;</i>which was a National Book Award Finalist.&nbsp;She is a former visiting professor at the London School of Economics, a former member of <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i> editorial board, a former deputy editor of <i>The Spectator</i> magazine, and a former Warsaw correspondent of <i>The Economist</i>.&nbsp;Her essays appear in&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New Republic, Foreign Policy </i>and<i> Foreign Affairs</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> www.anneapplebaum.comA journey through middle Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, of which George Orwell would have been proud, if he had extended his own travels from the Road to Wigan Pier to Minsk. This is not a land flowing with milk and honey. The region and its peoples have been fought over, uprooted, persecuted, and killed for a thousand years. Just in this century, the Borderlands have survived the collapse of three empires, the division of the spoils after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, the Second World War, the Holocaust, Stalin's despotism, and the fall of the Soviet Union. As Applebaum, foreign editor for the London Spectator, aptly comments, ``To sift through the layers, one needs to practice a kind of visual and aural archeology.'' She does so with sensitive skill, noting how the cobblestones have disappeared beneath cracked concrete, how medieval foundations have vanished behind ``spectacular monotony,'' and how churches and shops have given way to numbered apartment blocks. She records the rival nationalisms- -Lithuanians hating Poles, Poles hating Lithuanians, everyone hating the Russians. She sees the miles of rusting Soviet naval ships in Kaliningrad, the pit behind the courthouse in Woroniaki in the Ukraine where the KGB dumped the bodies of those they had executed, and records the changes that have taken place as a Ukrainian professor of atheism renames himself professor of religion but delivers the same lectures. She ends her visit in Odessa, with its elegant houses, the only upbeat part of the trip. Otherwise, one is inclined to agree with the Russian who observes sourly that there is no difference between a peasant on the Volga and a man living in the African jungle except that the African has sunlight, fresh air, clean water, and no ice in the winter. The decor may be Soviet drab and mildew, but the book is intelligent, evocative, filled with vivid characterization and an understanding of the history of the area. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The entire emphasis of foundational physics has been adjusted in order to properly support the specific information on digital imaging that will follow. The paradigm shift in imaging terminology is reflected by the careful phrasing of concepts, accurate descriptions and clear illustrations throughout the book. There are 713 illustrations, including meticulous color line drawings, numerous photographs and stark radiographs. The two chapters on digital image processing alone include 60 beautifully executed illustrations. Foundational chapters on math and basic physics maintain a focus on energy physics. Obsolete and extraneous material has been eliminated, while concepts supporting digital imaging are more thoroughly discussed. All discussion of electricity is limited to only those concepts which bear directly upon the production of x-rays in the x-ray tube. Following is a full discussion of the x-ray beam and its interactions within the patient, the production and characteristics of subject contrast, and an emphasis on the practical application of radiographic technique. This is conventional information, but the terminology and descriptions used have been adapted with great care to the digital environment. No fewer than ten chapters are devoted directly to digital imaging, providing extensive coverage of the physics of digital image capture, digital processing techniques, and the practical applications of both CR and DR. Image display systems are brought up to date with the physics of LCD screens and electronic images. PACS and medical imaging informatics are also covered. Chapters on Radiation Biology and Protection include an unflinching look at current issues and radiation protection in practice. The radiation biology is clearly presented with numerous lucid illustrations, and a balanced perspective on radiation and its medical use is developed. To reinforce mathematical concepts for the student, dozens of practice exercises are strategically dispersed throughout the chapters, with answer keys provided in the appendix. Extensive review questions at the end of each chapter give a thorough, comprehensive review of the material learned. The Instructor Resources for Radiography in the Digital Age, available on disc, includes the answer key for all chapter review questions and a bank of over 1500 multiple-choice questions for instructors use. It also includes 35 laboratory exercises, including 15 that demonstrate the applications of CR equipment.</p><p>A great feature of this book is the delineation and specificity of each chapter...well organized and...easy to follow. Pictures are used to great effect, adding context to the text. --David James Demick / Doody Enterprises / October 2018<br><br>Book reviewed by Dr. Silvia Pani, senior lecturer in applied radiation physics and programme director, MSc medical physics, University of Surrey. This textbook is aimed at radiography students and it builds on the author's expertise in running radiography training programmes. It covers the foundation physics, technology and practical aspects of radiology, as well as image processing. It is divided into four parts. Part one lays the maths and physics foundations, delving gradually from general physics and atomic physics into the physical principles underlying x-ray production. Part two introduces the physics underpinning the formation of the radiographic image and discusses the effect of beam parameters and geometrical parameters on image quality. All these aspects are addressed with a very practical approach, with plenty of examples from real radiographic images. Practical aspects, such as patient handling and positioning, the effect of various pathologies on imaging, the use of AEC in a range of typical cases, are also discussed. Digital imaging is introduced in part three. Various aspects of preprocessing, processing and post-processing are presented, with a range of examples from photography and radiography. Some of the topics (beam parameters, quality control) from part two are revisited from a digital imaging perspective; the design and functioning of various detectors are presented, as well as a number of clinical procedures and elements of imaging informatics. Part four complements the imaging aspects with elements of radiation biology and protection. There is good coverage of practical aspects such as procedures and guidelines for radiation protection, as well as of topics for further reading, such as the functioning of radiation monitors and the mechanisms for DNA damage. As the book is aimed at radiographers, many mathematical derivations are simplified in favour of qualitative approaches and practical rules of thumb . Concepts such as the Fourier Transform are introduced in an intuitive way and with plenty of examples. Each chapter opens with a list of learning objectives and ends with a summary and a set of review questions; throughout each chapter are practice questions and worked numerical examples. The diagrams are simple and clear. A student workbook, with fill in the blank quizzes, and two sets of resources for instructors, complements the book. The first set contains visual aids for each of the topics; the second includes the solutions to all questions in the textbook, as well as an extensive set of multiple choice questions and of lab worksheets covering many aspects of the topics in the book. These resources are a real strength of the book, which will appeal to students for its clear diagrams and the numerous real-world examples. --Dr. Silvia Pani / RAD Magazine / April 2019</p><h2>Polaris ATVs (85 - 97) Haynes Repair Manual (Paperback)</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

No one knows if he ever succeeded, though, as all trace of Albrek and his followers simply vanished from history. Now, however, the dwarves must find the magical talisman that Albrek carried with him before their mines run dry, which would threaten the livelihood of the entire dwarf realm. And so the newly named wizard Alexander Taylor joins a familiar company of adventurers on a quest to discover what happened to Albrek, find his mythical tomb, and locate the lost talisman. Discovering Albrek&#39;s fate, however, may be the least of the adventurers&#39; problems when they cross paths with an ancient, wandering paladin who has a taste for confrontation and paranoid belief that some great evil is working in all of the known lands. Alex and his friends must pass through the shadow of any empty oracle&#39;s tower, where a whispered legend is to about to come true, and strike out for the distant parts of Thraxon that are only spoken of in old tales and half-forgotten myths. Join Alex and his brave companions on an adventure that will test the limits of their courage.</p><p>M. L. Forman was born and raised in Utah and now resides in the foothills of the western Rockies.

The conventional wisdom offered to an addict&#x2019;s loved ones has been to let the addict &#x201c;hit bottom&#x201d; before intervening. Now intervention specialist Debra Jay challenges this belief and offers a bold new approach to treating addiction that provides a practical and spiritual lifeline to families struggling with alcohol or drug abuse.<br><br>In <b>No More Letting Go</b>, Jay argues that the traditional advice of &#x201c;letting go&#x201d; too often destroys both the addict and the family physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Jay contends that addiction is everybody&#x2019;s business&#x2013;not just the addict&#x2019;s&#x2013;and addiction doesn&#x2019;t have the right to trump the welfare of a family. <br><br>In short, highly accessible chapters written with warmth, understanding, and compassion, Jay weaves together philosophical and religious thought; new science on the brain function of an addict; the physical and psychological impact of addiction on family members; and poignant, real-life family stories.<br><i><br></i><b>No More Letting Go</b> is a powerful, informative guide that provides comfort, hope, and practical advice to anyone affected by a family member&#x2019;s addiction.</p><p>DEBRA JAY is the co-author of the Hazelden Guidebooks, <b>Love First: A New Approach to Intervention</b>, and <b>Aging and Addiction</b>.

They watch with disbelief as the alcoholic continues drinking while their lives are falling apart. Unable to convince the alcoholic to stop drinking, families begin searching for answers. In my years of working with the relatives of alcoholics and addicts, I have found that families rarely reach out for help until the drinking and drugging hit a crisis point, and then they are often told: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing you can do until the alcoholic wants help. You&#x2019;ll just have to let him hit bottom.&#x201d;<br><br> Hitting bottom is an old idea, still imposed upon families as if it were an absolute. Many families sadly believe that they must wait for alcoholics to hit bottom before there is any hope for recovery. They rarely stop to consider that this belief sentences them to years of unhappiness and devastation. No one ever mentions the fact that alcoholics and addicts don&#x2019;t take the trip to the bottom alone&#x2014;the family goes with them. Families are never warned that the journey to the bottom takes even the smallest children.<br><br> Hitting bottom should never be our first strategy; it is a strategy of last resort. Only when every reasonable intervention technique is exhausted should we let someone free-fall. Even then, there are ways to raise the bottom, to stretch out the safety net of treatment and recovery. Addiction always presents new opportunities. The trick is recognizing them and knowing how to take action.<br><br> The premise of hitting bottom is that addicts hit one bottom and, when they get there, either are struck sober or go running for the nearest treatment center. But addicts are resilient. They find people to rescue them. They often bounce along the bottom for years without a flicker of recognition that they need help. When they find themselves in a tough spot, alcohol whispers reassurances: There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about as long as you have me.<br><br> I was having dinner with some recovering alcoholics, and a particularly nice fellow in his late fifties was celebrating fifteen years of sobriety. He talked about living in a roach-infested one-room apartment above a bar for twelve years, drinking and doing drugs every single day. He said his life was miserable, but he just couldn&#x2019;t stop. He came close to dying several times before getting help. One of the people in our group said, &#x201c;Well, you just weren&#x2019;t ready.&#x201d; Someone else piped up with, &#x201c;It takes what it takes.&#x201d; Everyone&#x2019;s head nodded in agreement. Stunned that my dinner companions thought that this man had had to lose some of the best years of his life before he was ready to get sober, I asked, &#x201c;Where was your family?&#x201d; He said his wife divorced him and his kids never came around. &#x201c;All for the better, really,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t any kind of father worth having.&#x201d; I asked what might have happened if everyone in his family, along with his closest friends, had come to him with a solid plan for recovery and an outpouring of love. Might he have accepted their help? Could it have turned out differently for him and his kids? Would his marriage have survived? He looked at me for a moment and then said, &#x201c;I never considered that before. Who knows, I might&#x2019;ve taken them up on their help. Maybe we could&#x2019;ve saved our family.&#x201d;<br><br> Do alcoholics ever hit bottom and then climb their way up into sobriety? Of course they do. But we never know who&#x2019;ll be the lucky ones or what price they&#x2019;ll pay along the way. Three hundred and fifty people a day find a bottom with no bounce&#x2014;death. Countless others go to prison, go insane, or just go nowhere. Families are torn apart, children lose one or both parents, and relationships are damaged beyond repair. But many begin a journey of recovery before hitting bottom&#x2014;the path is tough and rocky at first but becomes easier to travel as time goes on. Many things motivate alcoholics to make a turnaround before tragedy strikes, but it is usually family, friends, or employers. When the Hazelden Foundation asked sober alcoholics what set them on their new course to recovery, 77 percent said a friend or relative intervened. Someone cared enough to raise their bottom.<br><br> The best cases against hitting bottom are the real-life stories: A college-educated, forty-seven-year-old divorced father of three loses everything, lives in his parents&#x2019; basement drinking and smoking pot daily, and is unable to hold a job. A twenty-four-year-old trades his girlfriend&#x2019;s new car for crack cocaine. The police find a seventy-two-year-old grandmother half naked and passed out on her front lawn. Babies are strapped in the backseat as a mother drives drunk to buy more wine; the police stop her, taking the children to protective services and Mom to jail. A young father goes to bed drunk and suffocates on his own vomit. A successful thirty-two-year-old woman driving home intoxicated kills a father and his daughter when she slams into them on the freeway. All of these stories come from families I&#x2019;ve worked with, and no words can express their pain or deep, abiding sense of loss. Waiting for alcoholics to hit unknown bottoms results in much tragedy and heartbreak.<br><br> &#x201c;Bottoms&#x201d; can be temporary. Alcoholics resist getting sober even when things are going badly in their lives. They are good at weathering storms. Perhaps they&#x2019;ll swear off alcohol for a while, but as soon as things cool down, they begin drinking again. The addicted brain can&#x2019;t make lasting connections between alcohol and the problems it causes. Once the problems go away, alcohol is their best friend again. Addiction is both invisible and sacred to alcoholics: they deny its existence yet sacrifice everything to it.<br><br> Addicts don&#x2019;t want to cause trouble or hurt the people they love. Quite the contrary: they struggle to be the person they think they still are, the person they were before the addiction took hold. They can&#x2019;t make sense of their own actions. As their addiction progresses and troubles mount, they work harder to manage their lives, but addiction never lets anyone lead a life free of trouble. There are always problems, big and small. Bad behavior, poor decisions, and emotional upheaval are all symptoms of this disease, which affects both the brain and the soul. Families are confused, too. Not understanding what is happening to their loved one, they mutter, &#x201c;When will she learn?&#x201d; But addicts can&#x2019;t learn because addiction keeps tightening its grip, demanding complete allegiance.<br><br> The apostle Paul could have been describing an addict when he wrote: &#x201c;I do not understand my own behavior; I do not act as I mean to, but I do things that I hate. Though the will to do what is good is in me, the power to do it is not; the good thing that I want to do, I never do; the evil thing which I do not want&#x2014;that is what I do.&#x201d; As alcoholics try to resolve the conflict between how they want to behave and how they are behaving, in the end, the only solution they can see is another drink.</p><h2>The Cloud of Unknowing: A New Translation of the Classic 14th-Century Guide to the Spiritual Experience</h2><p>In fourteenth-century England an anonymous monk wrote an extraordinary text illuminating the life of contemplative devotion and the drama of the soul&#x2019;s union with God.

The Best of Winston Churchill&#39;s Speeches</h2><p>Winston Churchill was the most eloquent and expressive statesman of his time. It was as an orator that Churchill became most completely alive, and it was through his oratory that his words made their greatest and most enduring impact.

He has chosen from his grandfather&#39;s entire output and thoughtfully introduces each selection. The book covers the whole of Churchill&#39;s life, from the very first speech he made to those of his last days. It includes some of Churchill&#39;s best-known speeches as well as some that have never before been published in popular form. Today, Sir Winston Churchill is revered as an indomitable figure and his wisdom is called upon again and again. Reading these speeches, from the perspective of a new century, we can once again see Sir Winston Churchill&#39;s genius and be moved and inspired by his words.</p><p>The editor, <strong>Winston S.

She wonders why does her best friend, Lydia, have to wear a yellow star? Why are people in hiding and using strange names? What is Lydia afraid of? Touching upon the Holocaust with sensitivity and poignancy, <i>Star of Fear, Star of Hope </i>will help readers understand this difficult event in history.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchGrade 2-4?This extraordinarily moving picture book, originally published in France and set in the north of France during World War II, has spare prose and appropriately stark illustrations. An elderly woman recalls an incident in her childhood that she would give anything to undo. Her Jewish friend Lydia is visiting, and, in the middle of the night, a frightened Jewish woman seeking refuge awakens them by pounding on the door of a "safe house" across the hall. Lydia then asks to be taken home. With deep sorrow and guilt, Helen remembers that she shouted at her friend for leaving on the eve of her birthday. Stars are the symbols around which the story turns. Lydia's mother, sewing the yellow star on her daughter's jacket, explains that a new law compels Jews to wear them but that "the place for stars is in the sky." The woman in the hall is trying to tear the star off her coat and when Helen, already contrite, opens the birthday present left for her by Lydia, she sees a paper doll with Lydia's face painted on, complete with a wardrobe including a jacket with a star. Helen never sees her friend again and, for a long time, she is angry at the stars. The illustrations appear to be of charcoal and crayon pastels in subdued colors with black outlines. The drawings are simple and barely rounded, almost as if the figures were paper dolls, as well. A mood of fear and impending doom prevails. Will it reach children? Absolutely. There is no book exactly like this one. Elisabeth Reuter's Best Friends (Yellow Brick Road, 1993) is somewhat similar, but Star is the superior title.?Marcia W.

Pat Coleby believes that how you farm determines the health of your livestock and she brings a wealth of animal husbandry experience to bear in this analysis of many serious problems of contemporary farming practices, focusing in particular on how poor soils lead to mineral-deficient plants and ailing farm animals. <p>Encompassing every facet of farm management, from the mineral components of the soils cattle graze over, to issues of fencing, shelter and feed regimens, Coleby provides system-level solutions and specific remedies for optimizing cattle health and productivity. She covers strategies for improving farm efficiency, breeding issues, common ailments and remedies, land regeneration and maintenance, and much more. Long revered in Australia as an outstanding expert in her field, Natural Cattle Care is an invaluable everyday resource for everyone with cattle.</p></p><p>Coleby has been instituting eco-farming techniques in Australia for the last half-century. She practices commercial-scale farming and writes and travels extensively as a lecturer and farm consultant. Early on in her career, she realized that conventional veterinary medicine was far from a cure-all. She recognized that good nutrition is the key to preventing ill health in animals, and her prescriptions of non-invasive, natural remedies resulted in amazing, seemingly miraculous cures in animals whose cases conventional veterinary wisdom would abandon. As word of the success of her natural treatment spread, Coleby quickly became known as an expert on holistic animal care. Coleby has written numerous books on holistic livestock husbandry and land stewardship including Natural Sheep Care, Natural Goat Care and Natural Horse Care, also available from Acres U.S.A.</p><h2>The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the Bancroft Award: "Monumental...a tour de force...awesome in its coverage of political events."&#x2015;Gordon Wood, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> Acclaimed as the definitive study of the period by one of the greatest American historians, <em>The Rise of American Democracy</em> traces a historical arc from the earliest days of the republic to the opening shots of the Civil War. Ferocious clashes among the Founders over the role of ordinary citizens in a government of "we, the people" were eventually resolved in the triumph of Andrew Jackson. Thereafter, Sean Wilentz shows, a fateful division arose between two starkly opposed democracies&#x2015;a division contained until the election of Abraham Lincoln sparked its bloody resolution. Winner of the Bancroft Award, shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, a <em>New York Times</em> 100 Notable Books of 2005 and best book of <em>New York</em> magazine and <em>The Economist</em>.</p><p>Sean Wilentz is the George Henry Davis 1886 Professor of American History at Princeton University and author of the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning The Rise of American Democracy, Bob Dylan in America, and many other works. He is completing his next book, No Property in Man, on slavery, antislavery, and the Constitution, based on his Nathan I. Huggins Lectures delivered at Harvard in 2015.As the revolutionary fervor of the war for independence cooled, the new American republic, says Princeton historian Wilentz, might easily have hardened into rule by an aristocracy. Instead, the electoral franchise expanded and the democratic creed transformed every aspect of American society. At its least inspired, this ambitious study is a solid but unremarkable narrative of familiar episodes of electoral politics. But by viewing political history through the prism of democratization, Wilentz often discovers illuminating angles on his subject. His anti-elitist sympathies make for some lively interpretations, especially his defense of the Jacksonian revolt against the Bank of the United States. Wilentz unearths the roots of democratic radicalism in the campaigns for popular reform of state constitutions during the revolutionary and Jacksonian eras, and in the young nation's mess of factional and third-party enthusiasms. And he shows how the democratic ethos came to pervade civil society, most significantly in the Second Great Awakening, "a devotional upsurge... that can only be described as democratic." Wilentz's concluding section on the buildup to the Civil War, which he presents as a battle over the meaning of democracy between the South's "Master Race" localism and the egalitarian nationalism of Lincoln's Republicans, is a tour-de-force, a satisfying summation and validation of his analytical approach. 75 illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tim Parks reveals how the legendary Medicis&#x2015;Cosimo and Lorenzo &#x201c;the Magnificent&#x201d; in particular&#x2015;used the diplomatic, military, and even metaphysical tools at hand, along with a healthy dose of intrigue and wit, to further their fortunes as well as their family&#x2019;s standing.</p><p>Tim Parks was born in Manchester, England, in 1954, grew up in London, and has lived in Italy since 1981. His novels include Europa, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and he is the author of several nonfiction accounts of life in Italy, including Italian Neighbors and An Italian Education. During his years in Italy, Parks has translated works by Italo Calvino, Roberto Calasso, Alberto Moravia, and Machiavelli. He is a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books, for which he blogs.Starred Review. The Renaissance, so often seen as a clean break with the medieval past, was really an age of creative ambivalence and paradox. In this marvelously fresh addition to the Enterprise series, Parks, author of the Booker-listed <i>Europa</i> and a literary observer of modern Italian life, turns to Florence and to a particularly compelling contradiction. The spirit of capitalist enterprise that fostered cultural originality and underpinned patronage was accompanied by a Christian conviction that money was a source of evil and that usury was a damnable spiritual offense. In the space where this cultural conflict plays out, sometimes as stylized as one of Lorenzo Il Magnifico's tournaments, sometimes as life-threateningly fiery as Savonarola's sermons against worldly vanities, we find a world both akin to our own and almost incomprehensibly distant. Parks is a clear-eyed guide to the ambiguities of Florentine culture, equally attentive to the intricacies of international exchange rates, the spiritual neurosis about unearned income, the shocking bawdiness of Lorenzo's carnival songs and the realpolitik of 15th-century power. His prose is swift and economical, cutting to the chase. Like the Medici-commissioned funerary monument for the anti-Pope John XXIII, the effect is startlingly vibrant, resembling "those moments in Dante's <i>Inferno</i> when one of the damned ceases merely to represent this or that sin and becomes a man or woman with a complex story, someone we are interested in, sympathetic towards." <i>(May) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The authors organize the book in a question-and-answer format, with heartfelt testimonials interspersed throughout. Their goal was to open the range of experience and exposure for pregnant women so when they "make decisions regarding where and how to birth, [they] will be making truly informed ones." Drichta and Owen stress that midwives focus on the mother and family--developing a strong relationship, educating the mother and creating a birthing plan tailored to the mother's preferences. The authors' relationship-centered chapters walk readers through each step of pregnancy and delivery, including nutrition, prenatal testing, home birth after a cesarean and 10 common pregnancy-related issues. The authors also discuss special circumstances such as twins and breech babies. In addition, Drichta and Owen instruct readers on how to prepare their home for birth (a clean bathroom is key). They also admit that not every birth can take place at home, counseling mothers to have a written plan if they must transfer to a hospital. The authors back up their assertions with statistics, and each chapter is footnoted. Appendixes include questions to ask when choosing a home-birth attendant, a home-birth reading list, websites for childbirth education and support, and resources for high-risk births.

At a time when C-sections make up an estimated 30 to 50 percent of U.S. births, this book by two midwives and nurse educators puts the power back into mothers&#x2019; hands. And it offers guidance to all pregnant women, not only those who plan to deliver at home. Drichta and Owen talk about prenatal nutrition (nix the sugar and processed foods) and urge pregnant women to simply enjoy themselves. They note that, contrary to popular belief, women who miscarry are not at increased risk of miscarrying again unless they experience three sequential miscarriages. They recommend making a &#x201c;birth kit,&#x201d; including flexible straws (easier to drink from during labor), a heating pad, and lots and lot of towels.

One of the struggles I&#x2019;ve had when navigating the world of homebirth is that the amount of unbiased reliable information is very small.

Loving ourselves and others is in our genetic code. It&#x2019;s nothing other than the purpose of our lives&#x2014;but knowing that doesn&#x2019;t make it easy to do. We may find it a challenge to love ourselves. We may have a hard time letting love in from others. We&#x2019;re often afraid of getting hurt. It is also sometimes scary for us to share love with those around us&#x2014;and love that isn't shared leaves us feeling flat and unfulfilled. <br><br>David Richo provides the tools here for learning how to love in evolved adult ways&#x2014;beginning with getting past the barriers that keep us from loving ourselves, then showing how we can learn to open to love others. <br><br>The first challenge is that we have a hard time letting love in: recognizing it, accepting it from others. We're afraid of it, of getting hurt. The second, related problem is that we're unable to share love with those around us--and love that isn't shared isn't truly love. The first step to learning to love and be loved, according to Richo's model, is to identify the different levels of love so that you can hit each one separately. He breaks it down to three:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Level One: Positive Connection. As simple as being courteous, respectful, helpful, and honest, and decent in all our dealings. Pretty basic, but it makes the world a better place, and it's the essential foundation for growing in love. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Level Two: Caring and Personal Connection. Intimacy and commitment to friends, family, partners, lovers. Commitment to others. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Level Three: Unconditional and Universal. Transcending the love of individuals to the love of all beings; self-sacrificing. The love expressed in the Sermon on the Mount and the Bodhicharyavatara. This level of love isn't for a heroic few, it's everyone's calling. <br><br>He then shows us how to incorporate these varieties of love into our lives. It's a relief to know that even just aspiring to incorporate them really changes things. He also provides exercises and guided meditations for identifying and getting through the things that keep you from getting and giving love at each of these three levels.<br><br>Through the lens of these types of love, Richo covers topics such as: how to still be yourself while loving another; how to embrace your dark side; what to do when the one who loves you dies; need versus fear; clinging; healthy sexuality, including fantasies and how to experience pleasure without guilt; how to break distructive patterns in your relationships; and how to have safe conversations with your loved one.<br><br>Richo provides wisdom from Buddhism, psychology, and a range of spiritual traditions, along with a wealth of practices both for avoiding the pitfalls that can occur in love relationships and for enhancing the way love shows up in our lives. He then leads us on to love&#x2019;s inevitable outcome: developing a heart that loves universally and indiscriminately. This transcendent and unconditional love isn&#x2019;t just for a heroic few, Richo shows, it&#x2019;s everyone&#x2019;s magnificent calling.</p><p>DAVID RICHO, PhD, is a psychotherapist, teacher, writer, and workshop leader whose work emphasizes the benefits of mindfulness and loving-kindness in personal growth and emotional well-being.

Forty years ago, rental car company Avis challenged Hertz&#x2014;the big fish in its industry&#x2014;and won a larger, more profitable share of the market by "trying harder." Today, Challengers such as method, JetBlue, Nintendo Wii, and Linux successfully compete with much bigger brands in their markets by redefining in their favor the criteria consumers use to make choices. The leaders in any market are never in reality invulnerable; they just seem that way before a smart, focused, Challenger brand takes them on. <p>Updated and revised with additional chapters and thirty new examples of Challenger brands in action, the <i>Second Edition of Eating the Big Fish</i> reflects recent developments in the marketplace and media since the publication of the bestselling and influential first edition.

He presents eight Challenger credos that stress bringing a fresh perspective to market, building a prominent and emotionally appealing identity, implementing a pervasive communication strategy, and focusing intently on ideas rather than consumers.</p> <p>This new edition explores what needs to change and what needs to stay the same for Challenger brands in the shifting communications landscape of media, technology, and the Web. Most important, it affirms that Challenger brands are alive, well, and hungry.

Helguera&#39;s spunky primer promises to offer a much-needed critical compass for those adrift in the expanded social field.&#34; -Claire Bishop, Professor of Contemporary Art and Exhibition History, CUNY, and author of Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship &#34;This is an extremely timely and thoughtful reference book. Drawn from empirical and extensive experience and research, it provides a curriculum and framework for thinking about the complexity of socially engaged practices. Locating the methodologies of this work in between disciplines, Helguera draws on histories of performance, pedagogy, sociology, ethnography, linguistics, community and public practices. Rather than propose a system he exposes the temporalities necessary to make these situations possible and resonant. This is a tool that will allow us to consider the difficulties of making socially engaged art and move closer to finding a language through which we can represent and discuss its impact.&#34; -Sally Tallant, Artistic Director, Liverpool Biennial &#34;Helguera has produced a highly readable book that absolutely needs to be in the back pocket of anyone interested in teaching or learning about socially engaged art&#34; -Tom Finkelpearl, Director of the Queens Museum, New York, and author of Dialogues in Public Art</p><p></p><h2>Why Is Blue Dog Blue?</h2><p>Paintings of Blue Dog in many different colors, including salmon, cherry, and moss green, explain why Blue Dog had to be blue.</p><p>Ages 4-8. Cajun artist George Rodrigue first painted his distinctive, blueberry-colored pooch in 1984. Since then, Blue Dog has become a pop icon, the subject of several books by the author and many canvasses loved by both celebrities and the story-hour set, the audience for this picture book. Here, Rodrigue answers the title question by explaining that Blue Dog's color depends on what the artist is doing: when Rodrigue goes fishing, he paints the dog a salmon color; when Rodrigue wants a hot dog, he paints the dog mustard yellow, and so on. The text seems mostly a vehicle for introducing colors that belong in an upscale clothing catalogue (alabaster, emerald), and an unsatisfying quasi-cosmic remark finally answers the title question. Despite the problems, young Blue Dog fans will enjoy seeing their favorite pup dressed in different colors, and Rodrigue's liberating reminder that "Artists don't have to paint things the way they really are" may inspire kids to discover new colors and use them creatively. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She was met with such acclaim that P�rez&#x2019;s original commitment of six months was extended, and extended, until almost five years had passed. In collaboration with co-writer Len Wein and inker Bruce Patterson, P�rez spearheaded Wonder Woman&#x2019;s adventures for years, leading her to an unprecedented level of success. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now these groundbreaking tales are available in the first of a series of trade paperbacks, collecting WONDER WOMAN #1-14 with bonus material including a Who&#x2019;s Who of Wonder Woman&#x2019;s world and an art gallery.</p><p>George P�rez started drawing at the age of five and hasn't stopped since. Born on June 9, 1954, P�rez began his professional comics career as an assistant to Rich Buckler in 1973. After establishing himself as a penciller at Marvel Comics, P�rez came to DC in 1980, bringing his highly detailed art style to such titles as JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA and FIRESTORM. After co-creating THE NEW TEEN TITANS in 1980, P�rez and writer Marv Wolfman reunited for the landmark miniseries CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS in 1985. In the aftermath of that universe-smashing event, P�rez revitalized WONDER WOMAN as the series' writer and artist, reestablishing her as one of DC's preeminent characters and bringing in some of the best sales the title has ever experienced.

Because few have electricity, at home, Nepali families use tukis, or kerosene lamps, that are very smoky and produce unhealthy fumes. Although the solar lamp is expensive, the girls are certain that it would help quiet their baby brother's smoke-induced cough. They excitedly share the information about the "magic light" with their father. However, it isn't until he sees one working at a neighbor's house that he becomes interested. The new lamps cost more than the family has available, so the girls brainstorm ways they can earn the money. They decide to sell bunches of colorful rhododendrons that grow in the hills. Arriving early to market, Deena has time to tell Chandra a story of the sun god, Surya, and the moon god, Chandra. The young girl is proud to be named for such a powerful god. The girls' stall does well, and they are able to purchase the last solar light available. That night, their little brother sleeps and breathes peacefully. The full-color, mixed-media illustrations dominate the pages with vitality and detail. Thorough endnotes provide much information about Nepal, its people and solar power as well as instructions for making a solar oven. This tale of sibling compassion and ingenuity provides enough story for enjoyment alone but would also work well as an introduction to another culture and religion.&#x2014;Sara-Jo Lupo Sites, George F.

The waves of immigrants that later came to the United States gradually accepted these values and assimilated into America's Anglo-Protestant culture. More recently, however, our national identity has been eroded by the problems of assimilating massive numbers of primarily Hispanic immigrants and challenged by issues such as bilingualism, multiculturalism, the devaluation of citizenship, and the &#x201c;denationalization&#x201d; of American elites.<br> <br>September 11 brought a revival of American patriotism and a renewal of American identity, but already there are signs that this revival is fading. Huntington argues the need for us to reassert the core values that make us Americans. Timely and thought-provoking, <i>Who Are We?</i> is an important book that is certain to shape our national conversation about who we are.</p><p>Samuel P. Huntington was the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor at Harvard University, where he was also the director of the John M. Olin Institute for Stategic Studies and the chairman of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies. He was the director of security planning for the National Security Council in the Carter administration, the founder and coeditor of <i>Foreign Policy,</i> and the president of the American Political Science Association.<p> As at so many other critical junctures in recent history -- during the Vietnam War, at the height of the soul-searching that followed, as the Cold War drew to a close -- Samuel P. Huntington has written a book that poses some of the most critical questions facing our nation. The epochal change before us now is globalization, and Huntington is as penetrating as ever in his assessment of the challenges it creates -- challenges, he shrewdly sees, that go far beyond the economic. What distinguishes America, or any nation for that matter, in a shrinking world where international frontiers mean less and less? How can a people already preoccupied with ethnic identity absorb and acculturate the millions of immigrants being driven to our shores by global economics? And how in the long run will America cohere if everyone feels they belong to a minority?</p><p> Who Are We? tackles these questions with passionate intensity. As Huntington argues, nations "come and go," and a strong sense of "national consciousness" is surely critical to America's success or failure. It's all the more disappointing, then, that Who Are We? slips far too often into paranoid threat-mongering instead of honestly weighing the quandaries of the newly globalizing American nation. And its proposed solution for the United States -- an insular, "Anglo-Protestant" cultural fortress -- seems a poor road map indeed for navigating the new world ahead.</p><p> The strongest part of the book is its premise: that nationality matters -- and that, despite the universalism central to our values, America is different from other countries. In Huntington's view, this distinctiveness is based in "culture," by which he means neither Walt Whitman nor MTV, but rather a shared sense of community and common mores, including the premium we put on individualism, the work ethic, the gospel of success and an often crusading moralism. One can quarrel with some of the elements he thinks are central -- most important, a single, shared religion -- but plainly Huntington is on to something. Hard as it may be for us to define what it means to be American, people the world over know it when they see it, and we lose touch with it at our peril.</p><p> Where Huntington goes wrong, first of all, is in diagnosing the threats to this culture. Concerned that many Americans do not grasp the urgency of the issue, he piles on chapter after anxious chapter documenting potential dangers. Some of his points are well taken, though familiar enough: alarums about affirmative action, bilingual education, dual citizenship and the like. The problem even here, where he is on most solid ground, is that Huntington can't seem to see anything but bad news -- can't grasp, for example, how multiculturalism has ebbed since Sept. 11, or the way some apparently disturbing trends like dual citizenship are more symbolic than real and paradoxically can boost national cohesion, in this case by easing the way for many immigrants to become American citizens. Worse still, in other instances, convinced by his own conjecture that a trend could pose a threat, Huntington badly distorts the evidence or masks it with overheated speculation.</p><p> The most misleading chapters are those that deal with Hispanic immigrants. In Huntington's nightmare vision, we are headed for a "bilingual, bicultural society," where Latinos take over some states, Anglos retreat to others, most of our big cities look like the barrios of Los Angeles and U.S. foreign policy is dictated in Mexico City. Huntington is not wrong that today's Latino influx differs in many ways from previous immigrant waves: the sheer number coming from a single non-English speaking region, for example, and the way modern communications make it easier to maintain ties to the Old Country. But existing evidence about Hispanic assimilation simply does not support his apocalyptic fears -- as he himself often lets on in the fine print under an inflammatory topic sentence. Newly arrived Latinos are among the most patriotic Americans -- enlisting, for instance, in record numbers and now dying bravely in Iraq. For all the fulminations of a few angry activists, there is no evidence that the majority harbor irredentist designs on the Southwest or do not want their children to become full Americans. Study after study shows that virtually everyone in the second generation grows up proficient in English, and by the third generation, two-thirds speak only English.</p><p> But arguably even more wrong-headed is the prescriptive half of the book: a long, fervent historically based case that America is inherently an Anglo-Protestant nation and that we cannot hope to flourish unless we embrace that definition. Huntington argues convincingly -- and who can doubt? -- that the soil in which America's distinctive culture first took root was both English and dissenting. The earliest settlers' values still do much to color ours, and the "American Creed" that unites us politically -- our belief in freedom, tolerance, equal opportunity, the rule of law and the like -- is plainly a product of the British Enlightenment. But to say that our national character is Anglo-Protestant is to mistake origins for essence.</p><p> Huntington's selective history leaves out the critical ways in which early Americans revised and repudiated their Anglo inheritance -- most fundamentally with the separation of church and state and their rejection of the class-based hierarchies that bind British society. The result was a radically new nation based on a universalist conception of man and open to anyone -- including, over time, tens of millions of non-Anglo immigrants. Despite persistent fears much like those Huntington voices today, these newcomers and their children invariably became Americans. The very act of living in a free, democratic society ensures this outcome by rewarding the habits of the heart -- the quick pursuit of opportunity, self-sufficiency, the work ethic and the like -- that Huntington identifies as American culture. True, each successive wave added a distinctive flavor to the mix: new food, new music, new ways of approaching family, fun and even politics. But the newcomers made little dent in the essential core of what it means to be American: Their sectarian, communal identities have always given way to tolerant individualism, for example, and even those from the most authoritarian societies have eventually embraced our egalitarianism. Still, to claim that this core remains Anglo-Protestant only distorts its distinctiveness. It is also to exaggerate the challenges that immigration and ethnicity pose.</p><p> In the end, what's most disturbing about Who Are We? is its lack of confidence in the power of American identity. It's as if Huntington can't believe that our tolerant, universalist spirit could possibly stand up to an old-fashioned, ethnic nationalism of the kind that, say, today's Mexican immigrants arrive with. And, as a result, he needs to define our diffuse, big-tent essence down to the narrow orthodoxies of a more easily grasped culture, like Anglo-Protestantism. Of course, he's entitled to his fears and his pessimism, but it's a sorry approach for a self-styled "patriot" proposing to chart America's way into the global future. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Tamar Jacoby</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

But it is the <i>fl�neuse </i>who captures the imagination of the cultural critic Lauren Elkin. In her wonderfully gender-bending new book, the <i>fl�neuse </i>is a &#x201c;determined, resourceful individual keenly attuned to the creative potential of the city and the liberating possibilities of a good walk.&#x201d; Virginia Woolf called it &#x201c;street haunting&#x201d;; Holly Golightly epitomized it in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i>; and Patti Smith did it in her own inimitable style in 1970s New York.</p><p>Part cultural meander, part memoir, <i>Fl�neuse </i>takes us on a distinctly cosmopolitan jaunt that begins in New York, where Elkin grew up, and transports us to Paris via Venice, Tokyo, and London, all cities in which she&#x2019;s lived. We are shown the paths beaten by such <i>fl�neuses </i>as the cross-dressing nineteenth-century novelist George Sand, the Parisian artist Sophie Calle, the wartime correspondent Martha Gellhorn, and the writer Jean Rhys. With tenacity and insight, Elkin creates a mosaic of what urban settings have meant to women, charting through literature, art, history, and film the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes fraught relationship that women have with the metropolis.</p><p>Called &#x201c;deliciously spiky and seditious&#x201d; by <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Fl�neuse </i>will inspire you to light out for the great cities yourself.</p></p><p><b>Lauren Elkin</b>'s essays have appeared in many publications, including <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>,<i> frieze</i>, and <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, and she is a contributing editor at <i>The White Review</i>. A native New Yorker, she moved to Paris in 2004. Currently living on the Right Bank after years on the Left, she can generally be found ambling around Belleville.<p>"Absorbing . . . Elkin has an eye for the unexpected detail, as befits a <i>fl�neuse. . . </i>It will be up to booksellers to figure out how to categorize her pastiche of travel writing, memoir, history and literary nonfiction. A reader, <i>flaneusing</i> along the bookshelves, will find in it some of the pleasures of each." &#x2015;Diane Johnson, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;At a moment when women&#x2019;s rights have come to significant national attention, <i>Fl�neuse </i>also reads as a document of resilience, one that celebrates female figures fighting to be seen . . . Blending historical analysis, literary criticism, and memoir, Elkin seeks to re-define the concept of <i>fl�nerie </i>itself, and to reclaim the city for its women wanderers.&#x201d; &#x2015;Arnav Adhikari, <i>The Atlantic </i></p><p>"By focusing on six writers and artists . . . [Elkin's] book makes a forceful case for the genderless joy and vital importance of striking out for the territory&#x2015;on foot . . . <i>Fl�neuse </i>is a stimulating read whose itinerary ranges from wanderlust and space as a 'feminist issue' to self-definition in connection with a specific place." &#x2015;Heller McAlpin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> </p><p>"Lauren Elkin brings breadth and depth to a cocktail party crowded with genius . . . Her historical and literary portraits take their power from her talent for seeing aslant, making the familiar strange and vice versa . . . Ms. Elkin&#x2019;s clear-eyed view of her own fl�neuserie is one of the charms of a book that is pedestrian in the best possible sense: It makes you want to walk.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jane Kamensky, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"[An] eclectic and absorbing memoir and cultural history . . . The book strikes a rewarding balance between present and past, as it establishes and illustrates the much-needed definition of the flaneuse as "a determined, resourceful individual keenly attuned to the creative potential of the city, and the liberating possibilities of a good walk." &#x2015;Kathleen Rooney, <i>Chicago Tribune </i></p><p>&#x201c;An ambitious, powerful meditation on women in the urban space . . . Cities, in Elkin's rich, intelligent prose, become not static places that lend themselves to unidirectional efforts of observation, but whole dynamic languages&#x2015;interconnected networks of constantly changing symbols . . . Elkin's book is more than just a secret history of all the women who have illicitly occupied space. It's also a revelation of just how rich, and full of meaning, that space can be&#x2015;if you know how to be in it." &#x2015;Tara Isabella Burton, <i>Village Voice</i></p><p>&#x201c;An impressive and wide-ranging study . . . Walking after reading Elkin&#x2019;s book felt more greatly imbued with both intellectual purpose and gratitude, my own attentiveness to my surroundings heightened.

[Elkin's] literary peregrinations defy boundaries, fusing cultural history, criticism, psycho-geography and memoir. Both playful and bracingly intelligent, Elkin&#x2019;s elegant prose unfurls a portrait of the writer as an urban woman. . . With perhaps an eerie prescience, <i>Fl�neuse </i>examines the interrelationships of city, self and world." &#x2015;Marian Ryan, <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p>"<i>Fl�neuse </i>is a deeply pleasurable book, whether you are a man or a woman, whether you know these cities (or books, or writers, or artists) or not. You will see these streets anew, just as if you were a fl�neur in a New York neighborhood or along a canal in Venice. There is always something more to explore, just around the next corner&#x2015;or on the next page." &#x2015;<i>A.V. Club</i></p><p>&#x201c;In her richly evocative and absorbing debut, cultural critic Elkin homes in on the female version of the flaneur . . . In this insightful mix of cultural history and memoir, Elkin emerges at the protagonist as she mines her personal journey from the suburbs of Long Island to her current home in Paris.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Surely women also strolled and observed, Elkin thought, coining the term fl�neuse and embarking on a gloriously rambling quest to celebrate women worthy of this designation . . . Elkin shares her findings in a smart and shimmering mix of her own painful and exhilarating adventures . . . [She] concludes her splendidly discursive homage to intrepid women walkers with the sobering reminder that, in many places, &#x201c;a woman still can&#x2019;t walk in the city the way a man can.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"I've been waiting for years to see the history of women walkers in the city added to the critical literature of the flaneur&#x2015;and here, in Lauren Elkin's really smart and lovely book, it is." &#x2015;Vivian Gornick</p><p>&#x201c;An appealing blend of memoir, scholarship, and cultural criticism . . . Elkin's own story runs through the text like a luminous thread. She tells us the woman-in-the-street stories of Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf, George Sand, Sophie Calle, Agn�s Varda, and Martha Gellhorn, but all sorts of other cultural figures appear, including Barthes, Rilke, Baudelaire, Hemingway, Derrida, Dickens, and numerous others . . . Enlightening walks through cities, cultural history, and a writer's heart and soul.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"This is a book about wandering women, the author included, who build relationships with their cities by walking through them . . . Women can and do make feminist statements simply by strolling through their stomping grounds; Elkin creates an interesting and inarguable case for this. She, too, is a wanderer and provides compelling anecdotes about her own journeys, interspersed with those of literary heavy-hitters George Sand, Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf, and others . . . This is ultimately a celebration of women. You'll want to take a stroll by the end.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful . . . A joyful genealogy of the female urban walker . . . The book&#x2019;s narrative meanders brilliantly and appropriately across several time periods at once . . . Elkin&#x2019;s fl�neuse does not simply wander aimlessly, any more than Elkin does herself in this elegant book: she uses her reflection to question, challenge and create anew the life that she observes.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lara Feigel, <i>The </i><i>Guardian</i></p><p> &#x201c;<i>Fl�neuse</i> is not simply a reclaiming of space, but also of a suppressed intellectual and cultural history . . .

Named <i>Foxfire</i> after a local phosphorescent lichen, the magazine became one of the most beloved publications in American culture.</p><p>&nbsp;For four decades, <i>Foxfire</i> has brought the philosophy of simple living to readers, teaching creative self-sufficiency, home crafts, and the art of natural remedies, and preserving the stories of Appalachia. This anniversary edition brings us generations of voices and lessons about the three essential Appalachian values of faith, family, and the land. We listen to elders share their own memories of how things used to be, and to the new generations eager to preserve traditional values in a more complicated world. There are descriptions of old church services, of popular Appalachian games and pastimes, and of family recipes. Rich with memories and useful lessons, this is a fitting tribute to this inspiring and practical publication that has become a classic American institution.</p></p><p><p>The Foxfire Center brings together students and teachers to preserve the folk wisdom and values of simple living that reach back across centuries of life in the Appalachian Mountains of Northeast Georgia. The students and teachers publish a quarterly magazine and have written&nbsp;fourteen books over the years.</p>I advise you not to be carried away with the ways of the world. The Bible says, &#x201c;Love God, and love your neighbor.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the commandment that Jesus gave: Love God and love your neighbor. In order to do that, you&#x2019;ve got to study the Bible a whole lot, and you&#x2019;ve got to go to church and hear the Gospel preached. You&#x2019;ve got to mix and mingle with Christian people, and you&#x2019;ve got to worship your Maker. We were put here for a purpose. This world was made for man&#x2019;s enjoyment&#x2014;for man&#x2019;s use. Man was put in charge of the world and everything that&#x2019;s in it. We don&#x2019;t realize it, but the Spirit of the Lord is present at any time. You can call on It any time. If you call on It in faith, you&#x2019;ll get an answer.<br><br> &#x2014;Esco Pitts<br><br> So-called modern folks have faith. We have faith in the sun: When we awaken in the morning, the sun&#x2019;s rays will be warming the earth. We have faith in gravity: We can step with assurance, for we do not believe we will float away into space. We even have faith that the chair over which we are hovering will hold us if we sit in it. Some have faith in the almighty dollar, in other people, in science. Others even have faith in faith. This faith, however, is not the &#x201c;faith of our fathers, living still.&#x201d;<br><br> Why do so many people in our crowded, modern, technologically advanced world today feel isolated and alienated, depressed, empty, and afraid? Our world seems full of danger: The &#x201c;nice&#x201d; man next door is a child molester, robbers and rapists break into our homes, terrorists attack our homeland. The news media reports random acts of violence; the film industry depicts catastrophic forces threatening the very existence of Earth and its inhabitants: Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, and so many others. Nuclear weapons, toxic waste, and global warming threaten our habitat. The future looks bleak. Robert Burns wrote about man&#x2019;s perspective in his poem &#x201c;To a Mouse&#x201d;: &#x201c;And forward though I cannot see, I guess and fear.&#x201d; Many are indeed fearful of what tomorrow holds for mankind.<br><br> In the midst of such seeming chaos, many in society today search for some meaning and purpose for their lives. They wonder if the quest for meaning and purpose is realizable. Viktor Frankl, in his work Man&#x2019;s Search for Meaning, purported a truism applicable to society today: &#x201c;[P]eople have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning&#x201d; (142). For some, God is a myth. Atheists, for example, do not believe in what they see as an unprovable deity; therefore, Epicurus reigns: &#x201c;Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may die.&#x201d; Some ascribe to Nietzsche&#x2019;s philosophy: God is dead. Perhaps God did exist, but He died. Others espouse existentialism or nihilism: Life is a meaningless accident. Still others believe in the concept of naturalism: Cosmic forces conspire against humanity; environmental and biological determinism ensure our failure, no matter how mightily we struggle. To others God is a laissez-faire deity, some nebulous being somewhere who set the earth spinning and now watches to see how the creatures formed from dust fare. Furthermore, an afterlife is also &#x201c;unprovable&#x201d;: Heaven is a fantasy; hell hath no fury. Dust to dust, and it&#x2019;s over.<br><br> In contrast, folks whom we interviewed did not seem to harbor any such philosophies and fears. They are people whose sustaining faith enables them to live with calm assurance, for they believe in the reality of the resurrection. These elders talked to us about being raised in the church, about being saved, about some specific practices of their religion, about spiritual gifts, and even about heaven, hell, and the last days. They are people of faith&#x2014;the assurance of things hoped for, the certainty of things unseen (Hebrews 11:1)&#x2014;a deep, abiding faith in a Maker Who is actively involved in their lives, a triune God Who cares for them. Because of Him, they can face tomorrow. They have a purpose: to glorify God. They believe Jeremiah 29:11: &#x201c; &#x2018;For I know the plans I have for you,&#x2019; declares the Lord, &#x2018;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.&#x2019; &#x201d; The belief that God has a plan for them gives their lives meaning and hope. Their hope, however, is not in the things of this world but in the reality of the next: the unseen, eternal world of the spirit.<br><br> &#x2014;Angie Cheek<br><br> All scripture used in the &#x201c;Faith&#x201d; section is taken from the Holy Bible, New International Version� NIV� Copyright� 1973, 1978, 1984 by International Bible Society.

He began by telling a story: Out in space aimlessly floated steel, Plexiglas, aluminum, vinyl, copper . . . you get the picture. Anyway, all these materials were minding their own business when, for some unknown reason or provocation, they came together&#x2014;hard! Out of the aftershock of that huge wham of a consummation flew a 747! The professor used that analogy to explain to us that such an event made as much sense to him as the Big Bang theory. Even after all this time&#x2014;years!&#x2014;that analogy has stuck with me, and I have used it myself.<br><br> In his book Grendel (Beowulf told from the monster&#x2019;s point of view), author John Gardner depicts a wounded Grendel&#x2019;s speaking his final words as he sits on the edge of the bottomless chasm and prepares to hurl himself into the abyss: &#x201c;Poor Grendel&#x2019;s had an accident . . . so may you all&#x201d; (174). Grendel&#x2019;s search for meaning led this human-like monster to aver that life&#x2019;s events are mere accidents, that the only meaning for our lives is the meaning we ourselves ascribe to our existence. Is our existence accidental? The answer to that question is one each of us must discover for himself/herself.<br><br> We all desperately desire to discover the whys of life&#x2019;s triumphs and tragedies. Where is God when we need Him? Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do the wicked seem to prosper? Why, why, why? Our whys lead us to question God. We realize we know about Him, but we don&#x2019;t know Him. We are &#x201c;Oh, Best Beloved,&#x201d; like Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s &#x201c;Elephant&#x2019;s Child,&#x201d; &#x201c;full of &#x2018;satiable curiosity&#x2019; &#x201d;:<br><br> I know a person small&#x2014; She keeps ten million serving-men, Who get no rest at all: She sends &#x2019;em abroad on her own affairs, From the second she opens her eyes&#x2014; One million Hows, two million Wheres And seven million Whys.<br><br> We search for meaning. Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor, author, and psychoanalyst, in his work Man&#x2019;s Search for Meaning, among the most influential works of psychiatric literature, maintains that we choose our own way; that even though everything we have can disappear, we can choose our own attitude in any given set of circumstances. After being imprisoned in Auschwitz&#x2014;&#x201c;the very name stood for all that was horrible&#x201d; (Frankl, 22)&#x2014;and then in other concentration camps for a period of over five years during World War II, Frankl wrote the following: &#x201c;What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life . . . it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us&#x201d; (85).<br><br> Many in today&#x2019;s world, those who do believe in a supernatural creator, have a &#x201c;vending machine&#x201d; mentality concerning God. We say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve put in my quarter. I&#x2019;ve prayed. Now give me what I want. Bless my will.&#x201d; We&#x2019;re concerned with only that perpendicular pronoun I. We fail to ask God what He expects of us.<br><br> As you meet our Foxfire contacts, you will become aware of their deep desire to discover what God expects from them. They pray fervently. You will hear their deep convictions about their God, a God Who is alive and well, and about His mighty power, a saving power not only for tomorrow but for today. He, to them, is Savior, Sustainer, Comforter, Counselor, Friend. They seem not to question His will or His way. They trust and obey and thus live with the joy and peace of the Spirit.<br><br> &#x2014;Angie Cheek<br><br> &#x201c;I sit here and study by myself when I have a lot of time, and I think about things. I&#x2019;ve got so I can&#x2019;t read my Bible much because I can&#x2019;t see to read for long at a time. I think how thankful people ought to be that they&#x2019;re living in this beautiful world, and I wonder how they can ever think that there is not a higher power. Who makes all these pretty flowers? We can make artificial flowers, but they don&#x2019;t smell and are not as pretty as the flowers that we pick out there. We can&#x2019;t make flowers like the Almighty.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to have faith to believe in God. You&#x2019;ve got to have faith to know that He&#x2019;ll do what you&#x2019;ve asked Him to do if it&#x2019;s in His will. When we pray, we&#x2019;ve got to say, &#x2018;If it&#x2019;s Your will, God, do so and so.&#x2019; If you don&#x2019;t have faith enough in God, you can&#x2019;t live a very good Christian life.<br><br> &#x201c;I think that asking God for things is healthy. I think that God will grant what I ask for if it is His will. Sometimes we ask for things that&#x2019;s not God&#x2019;s will. And we sometimes don&#x2019;t have any faith in our prayers. You know, we forget the faith; and we think, I don&#x2019;t know if God will do that for me or not.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Aunt Addie Norton, Summer 1979<br><br> &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s right here b&#x2019;fore your eyes. You can see things a- happenin&#x2019; ever&#x2019; day. Different things. I was sittin&#x2019; here th&#x2019; other day, and a ol&#x2019; hen was comin&#x2019; through here that had chicks. She&#x2019;d go a little piece. Then she&#x2019;d cluck. Now what caused her t&#x2019; do that? I studied about that&#x2014;just sat here and watched. She&#x2019;d go a little piece; then she&#x2019;d cluck again. Now what makes her do that? &#x2019;At&#x2019;s Mother Nature. . . .<br><br> &#x201c;Why, you know that there&#x2019;s a higher power if y&#x2019; just look out. Now they talk about goin&#x2019; t&#x2019; th&#x2019; moon, and they may&#x2019;ve went. I don&#x2019;t know. But that moon . . . is it standin&#x2019; still or movin&#x2019;, or what about it? Rises here [points], and th&#x2019; mornin&#x2019; it&#x2019;s here&#x2014;plumb across th&#x2019; world. What d&#x2019; y&#x2019; think about that, now? And when it goes, it&#x2019;s dark nights. And when it starts up, it&#x2019;s a bright light thing. It&#x2019;s little and gets bigger and bigger. What changes that? They&#x2019;s somebody, somethin&#x2019;, behind it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kenny Runion, Fall 1971<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s just a few times in my life that I&#x2019;ve ever been afraid. My dad taught me not to be afraid. Now, he was quite religious. He grew up in the Methodist church. He was superintendent of the Sunday school, and he had this incredible faith.<br><br> &#x201c;He always told me that there&#x2019;s nothin&#x2019; in one place that&#x2019;s not goin&#x2019; to be in another. He told me not to be afraid at night out at a camp because I would be in just as much danger there as I&#x2019;d be sittin&#x2019; on my porch at home. He built up this immunity to fear in me at an early age, when I was four or five years old. Now, we lived about a fourth of a mile from the main store. All the men went there at night and gathered at the store. He&#x2019;d let me go with them down there, and then, when I got tired, he let me walk home by myself. He always told me to just go on, that nothin&#x2019; was goin&#x2019; to bother me, and nothin&#x2019; ever has.<br><br> &#x201c;Have faith in the universal life that you are connected to. Now they think of God as a man sittin&#x2019; up in a high throne with a long beard and white hair, but God is everywhere. It doesn&#x2019;t make any difference what you call Him. You can call Him &#x2018;Universal Mind,&#x2019; &#x2018;Allah,&#x2019; &#x2018;Jehovah,&#x2019; or anything you want to call Him, but He is still everywhere. I always think of it as electricity. You can&#x2019;t see it, but you know it&#x2019;s there. And you can always plug into this Universal Mind and have faith, and that will take care of you. It&#x2019;s just like electricity. You can take an iron, and you can&#x2019;t heat it unless you plug it in. You&#x2019;ve got to be in connection, and if you&#x2019;re in connection, there&#x2019;s nothing in the world that you can&#x2019;t do that your mind can conceive and dream.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Lyndall &#x201c;Granny&#x201d; Toothman, Fall/Winter 1991<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lived up here in the mountains, and I don&#x2019;t see nobody or talk to nobody much, but I think the bigger majority of people this day and time put all their values on money and things money can buy. They put all their values on the world and the things of the world, and they&#x2019;re leavin&#x2019; God out of it. . . .<br><br> &#x201c;You know, I think the Almighty made the world, made the moon and stars and everything in the world. He made the sun, and all of it is His. He put it where He wanted it. Do we have any authority to go up there and bother with it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x2014;Aunt Addie Norton, Fall 1976<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe they went to the moon. I don&#x2019;t know. But I just don&#x2019;t believe they did. Why, the moon is a . . . I never studied science in my life. I never did go t&#x2019; school farther than th&#x2019; seventh grade, and I&#x2019;m glad I got that much. Children, I&#x2019;m eighty-three years old. And that&#x2019;s the reason I never did care for science. And I read the Good Book, and the Good Book said that the moon was made to rule the earth and all the heavens therein, fishes of the sea an&#x2019; the fowls of th&#x2019; air and even man&#x2019;s body. And the moon rules the vegetation. I don&#x2019;t think they landed up there. You just know what they said. And how do y&#x2019; know but what they carried them rocks with &#x2019;em? Possibility&#x2019;s that they did. And if it was made t&#x2019; fool with, it&#x2019;d a-been put down in th&#x2019; reach of man. I believe that, too, &#x2019;cause we know that God created ever&#x2019;thing.<br><br> &#x201c;I think that the world has made great progress, but they&#x2019;s a few things that I think is money spent foolish, and that is tryin&#x2019; to go t&#x2019; th&#x2019; moon! I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s fair at all. God made everything. He made man t&#x2019; rule th&#x2019; earth and all the inhabitants therein. And He didn&#x2019;t make th&#x2019; moon for man t&#x2019; play with. If He did, He&#x2019;d put it down for man to reach. He&#x2019;d put it, anyhow, where man could get on a stepladder and go up! I don&#x2019;t think that it&#x2019;s . . . well, it&#x2019;s just no means! Th&#x2019; moon is th&#x2019; moon. Leave it alone! There&#x2019;s not a thing in the world up there but just th&#x2019; moon. And if they read th&#x2019; first chapter of Genesis, they&#x2019;ll find out what th&#x2019; moon is&#x2014;first and second chapters, I believe it is&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll find out how God created the earth. And He made everything. Man was created. The earth was made. I&#x2019;m not educated, of course, but it&#x2019;s true. We had it in Sunday school yesterday about th&#x2019; Creation.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x2014;Annie Perry, Summer/Fall 1975<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s through God we have all of our enjoyments, all of our good things. It&#x2019;s through Him that we get it. We know that for sure. We see some of His handiwork every time we look out and see somethin&#x2019; because He made everything on the earth, and He is the Creator of all the beauties everywhere.<br><br> &#x201c;The first thing when I get up of a mornin&#x2019; that I want to do is get to a door or window and look out, and I stand there and look and thank the Lord for bein&#x2019; able to see that beauty one more time. It&#x2019;s a wonderful thing to try to live a Christian life and to love the Lord. We have so much to be thankful for.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x2014;Beulah Perry, Summer 1974<br><br> &#x201c;Who is it that can make that little bush now right there? Can man? Who is it that can make the fountain of water eternally flow down out there and never stop&#x2014;flow day and night and never quit? You can go to bed and go to sleep and never wake up &#x2019;til in the mornin&#x2019;. When you get up, the creek is still a-flowin&#x2019;&#x2014;a beautiful sight! Who makes the sun shine every day that we live? Who makes the beautiful flowers bloom you look upon? Can man do it? That&#x2019;s why I know there&#x2019;s a God . . .

The answer is right inside.</p></p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Author Dannah Gresh</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Q: Describe how your new book will break new ground on the topic of sexuality and purity? </strong> <p><strong>A:</strong> <em>And the Bride Wore White</em> (a book I wrote over 10 years ago) has really transformed the way young women have chosen to live their lives. Over 20,000 churches have used it as a curriculum with their youth groups or in teen Sunday school classes. For that reason, I really want my readers who trust me to know that my new book <em>What Are You Waiting For?</em> will be grittier in substance. But the grittiness has a purpose. This book is needed, and the language that teens use about sexuality has changed. I&#x2019;m not going to shy away from topics like masturbation or words like orgasm, because I believe that teens know the words, and I think they need a biblical filter system to really sift through them, to define value to them and to figure out how their understanding of sexuality fits into their relationship with God as well as their relationship with their future spouse.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s one more unique difference in this book. In the last five years, science has drastically advanced our knowledge of how the body responds to sexuality. One of the biggest breakthroughs has been advanced brain scanning and chemical analysis that has provided a more complete picture of sexual brokenness. Whether you have a biblical view of sexuality or whether you have a view as an atheist, what we know now is that there is incredible brokenness in a young woman when she has a sexual partner and then breaks that relationship off.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s what we know: When a young woman has sex, her brain is covered with a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine, if you will, is an addiction drug. When the body experiences any kind of pleasure, whether it&#x2019;s from working out and getting a good sweat or from using cocaine, it washes the brain in dopamine. Now, it&#x2019;s a value-neutral drug so the brain doesn&#x2019;t determine &#x201c;this was a good thing for my body&#x201d; or &#x201c;This was a bad thing for my body.&#x201d; The activity raises the chemical level in your brain and creates a literal addiction to the source of the dopamine.</p> <p>What does that do for a young woman who is in a sexual relationship with someone? She becomes addicted to that person.</p> <p>So, we know a lot more about sex than we did 10 years ago when I wrote my first book, and I would like young women to be equipped with that information-- to look at everything sexual through God&#x2019;s eyes and through an intelligent understanding of sexuality.</p> <p><strong>Q: What have you heard from young women that confirms their eagerness and need for the insights they will find inside <em>What Are You Waiting For?</em></strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Their response to one other critical finding clearly demonstrates their hunger for this information. I&#x2019;ve taken the opportunity to trace God&#x2019;s word for the Hebrew word for sex through the Bible. Starting with Genesis 4: 1 where we first see it, I follow it all the way through to the book of Revelations. The word is &#x201c;yada.&#x201d;</p> <p>In looking at this word <em>yada</em>, we can see what God&#x2019;s heart really is on the subject of sex. We can even see it in our relationship with Jesus Christ. Every time I talk about this word, teens and college students come to me and say &#x201c;that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s kind of this &#x201c;eureka moment&#x201d; in which young women realize &#x201c;that&#x2019;s it...that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so sacred, that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m so sex crazed, that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so painful when I use it casually, that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s worth the wait.&#x201d; Everyone that&#x2019;s ever heard me talk about <em>yada</em> has this moment.</p> <p>This one amazing word-- I guess when you hear one word from God, it&#x2019;s big and it&#x2019;s powerful.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m excited to take it to print now after several years of teaching on it.</p> <p><strong>Q: What truth do you expect or hope will live on in readers&#x2019; hearts long after they&#x2019;ve finished the book?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I hope that they will take away the greater significance of the word <em>yada</em> because it&#x2019;s used in many important ways. For instance, the word is first used in Genesis 4:1-- &#x201c;Adam lay with his wife Eve&#x201d;-- that is &#x201c;Adam <em>yada</em> his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.&#x201d;</p> <p>But then it is also used in verses like, &#x201c;Be still and know (<em>yada</em>) that I am God.&#x201d;</p> <p>It&#x2019;s amazing to me that the word God uses to describe the holy intimate sexual relationship between a man and a woman is the same word that God uses to describe the nakedness and the intimacy that He wants to have in a relationship with us. It&#x2019;s mind blowing.</p> <p>As I traced this word from Genesis into the New Testament, it is also used in terms of the sacrifice of Christ where Jesus himself said that a marriage relationship is really just a picture of a deeper love that He has for his bride, the church.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s where the &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment lies.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s a G.K. Chesterton quote that I hope will be a catalyst to the &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment: &#x201c;Everyone who knocks on the door of a brothel is really looking for God.&#x201d;</p> <p>When you think about it, that&#x2019;s so true: everyone, whether they are looking at porn on the internet, or struggling with same-sex attraction, or involved in multiple sexual relationships--under it all, they are probably really looking for God.</p> <p>I hope that seeing this quote in the context of understanding <em>yada</em>, readers will be able to see the potential that their marriage relationship has to be a picture of Christ, and that they will be motivated to protect that picture. Because if our sexuality really is a picture of Christ in the church, how motivated do you think Satan is to destroy that picture?</p> <p>I want my readers to be deeply motivated to protect and experience sex as a really holy and deeply satisfying gift from God.</p> <p></p><b>DANNAH GRESH</b> is the best-selling author of several books, including <i>And the Bride Wore White </i>and <i>Lies Young Women Believe </i>(coauthored with Nancy Leigh DeMoss).

Author: Publishers Weekly, *STARRED REVIEW Source: June 9, 2014<br><br>Readers can be forgiven if they think that this lovely picture book and the 2009 Caldecott Medal winner, The House in the Night, by Susan Marie Swanson, share the same author. Of course that&#x2019;s because illustrator Krommes&#x2019; artwork is so intricately powerful that it tends to dominate each title. And as fine as the art is (and it&#x2019;s very fine), that&#x2019;s too bad, because both texts are outstanding. Here the story is about sun and rain and the effect it has on one family&#x2019;s day. The story opens with a mother hanging laundry on a line while the children play: &#x201c;Cotton clouds. Morning light. / Blue on blue. White on white.&#x201d; But as the farm animals look on, the sky darkens, and soon the rain is falling. The storm makes the daughter hide under her covers, pigs look on warily as streams of water rush through their pens, and the baby&#x2019;s cries meld with the torrent. Then everything slows&#x2014;enough so that the girl can go outside with her umbrella; enough so rain rivers turn to mud. And then, finally, there&#x2019;s sun once more. The lines of text are evocative and brief, giving children the opportunity to savor the words. The scratchboard-and-watercolor pictures expand the text with its country vistas and bring the intensity of storms close to home in the family scenes, offering more to see on each reading. A joyous, pelting, dripping celebration.

Author: Horn Book Source: Sept/Oct 2014<br><br>Debut author Dianne White describes in rhyming couplets the drama of a rainstorm. Caldecott Medalist Beth Krommes (The House in the Night) invents a visual story line about how it transforms the routine on an idyllic farm. <br> <br> The book opens at daybreak: "Cotton clouds./ Morning light./ Blue on blue./ White on white." Krommes's scratchboard and watercolor illustrations create layers of possibilities: a white bird in a blue sky, a blue roof on a white clapboard house with blue curtains in the window, a white sail on a blue river. A girl and her baby sibling play outside as their mother hangs laundry. "Weather changes./ Air grows colder" accompanies a horse's eye&#x2013;view from a hilltop: a farmer plows a field as his hat blows off, the pigs run for cover and, on the next page, the sailboat lists perilously. The girl and one of her two dogs hide under the covers in her room while, through the window, readers see the farmer lead the horses into the barn ("Thunder! Lightning!/ Raging, roaring"). Finally, "Winds shift./ Drops drip" and child and puppies venture out. One of the pups watches a turtle surface (children will love discovering two submerged turtles). "Muddy, muddy.../ everywhere!" ushers in a wallowing party for pigs and child.<br> <br> By moonrise, everyone is clean and peaceful ("Glitter stars, twinkling light./ Black on gold.../ on silver night"), from the house to the barn to the sea. Krommes connects these three setting through her palette and the stars shining through them all. --Jennifer M.

It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil&#x2019;s pact made between the Nazis and Germany&#x2019;s largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.</p> <p>Set against a backdrop ranging from Hitler&#x2019;s war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany&#x2019;s tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality. <em>The Pharmacist of Auschwitz</em> is a moving saga that lingers long after the final page.</p></p><p><p>Patricia Posner is a British-born writer who has collaborated with her husband, the author Gerald Posner, on twelve non-fiction books, including <em>Mengele: The Complete Story</em> &#x2013; a biography of Dr. Josef Mengele; <em>Hitler&#x2019;s Children</em> &#x2013; a 1991 collection of interviews with the children of Nazi perpetrators; and most recently, <em>God&#x2019;s Bankers</em> &#x2013; a financial history of the Roman Catholic Church.

A truly authentic and riveting read. A milestone in WWII and Holocaust history."<br><strong><em>--Damien Lewis, author of The Nazi Hunters</em></strong><br><br>"A harrowing, beautifully written and extremely well-researched account of a little-known aspect of the Holocaust. Patricia Posner's fine prose style grips from page one, and the horror will stay with you long after you finish the book." <br><strong><em>--Andrew Roberts, author of The Storm of War</em></strong><br><br>"A gruesome story, eloquently told." <br><strong><em>--Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>"Posner avoids sensationalism and gives us a harrowing and important read."<br><strong><em>--Jewish Renaissance</em></strong><br><br>"Posner's book doubles as the spellbinding story of Nazi Germany's largest industrial conglomerate, I.G. Farben . . . [and] in one important way, her book is a celebration of a rare kind of heroism. Its compelling side story offers an in-depth profile of Nazi hunter Fritz Bauer, who proved relentless in hunting down Capesius and bringing him to justice."&nbsp;<br><strong><em>--Dallas Morning News&nbsp;</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The research is impeccable . . .

From the first chapter, "Prayer", to her exegesis of Genesis and Revelation, to a Glossary of biblical terms, the author invites readers to deeply consider the allness of God, the perfection of man as God's spiritual creation, and how an understanding of these facts can free one from sin, disease, and death just as they did in biblical times.</p><p>The author, Mary Baker Eddy, devoted more than four decades to refining this message of hope, healing, comfort and spiritual strength. First published in 1875, this book has a 125-year history of inspiring and healing readers worldwide. It is published in English and in 16 different bi-lingual translations and has sold more than ten million copies.Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) was an influential American author, teacher, and religious leader. She is noted for her groundbreaking ideas about spirituality and healing, which she based on the Bible, particularly Christ Jesus' words and works. This system of healing, which she denominated Christian Science, puts into action all that she learned from her Bible study. Her ideas are fully articulated in her major work, the best-seller Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, first published in 1875. In 1879, she founded the Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts, which today has branch churches and societies around the world. She established her church "to commemorate the word and works of our Master, which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." In 1908 she launched <i>The Christian Science Monitor,</i> a leading international newspaper, the recipient, to date, of seven Pulitzer Prizes. At her passing, hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including <i>The Boston Globe,</i> which wrote, "She did a wonderful an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good."</p><h2>Wild Life in Woods and Fields (Yesterday&#39;s Classics) (Eyes and No Eyes)</h2><p>First volume in the &#34;Eyes and No Eyes&#34; series, introduces the youthful reader to the variety of animal and plant life that three children observe on their way to school through fields and woods.

But when Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia, Steven's world is turned upside down. He is forced to deal with his brother's illness and his parents' attempts to keep the family in one piece.

Not only did he make this story about a 13-year-old boy, whose little brother contracts leukemia, real and raw and heart-rending, he made it hysterically funny as well. Steven Alper, who is untalented in sports but terrific on the drums, is giving his pesky five-year-old brother Jeffrey oatmeal when Jeffrey, who has been complaining recently that his "parts hurt," falls off a stool and gets a nosebleed that just won't quit. That night Steven finds out that Jeffrey has leukemia. Although the plot-Steven's stressed-out family has no energy for him and he becomes a source of strength for his brother while simultaneously falling apart himself-is conventional, the subsidiary characters at home, school and the hospital have a flesh-and-blood reality and the situations ring true. Moreover, the reader falls in love with the brothers, laughing and crying by turns and rooting for both of them until it almost hurts. (Fiction. 12+) <br><br>Booklist Starred Review 9/15/05<br>\\\\\\\\*STAR* Sonnenblick, Jordan. Drums, Girls &amp; Dangerous Pie. Sept. 2005. Scholastic, $16 (0-439-75519-0). <br> Gr. 5-8. Steven Alper is a typical eighth-grader--smarter than some, certainly a better drummer than most, but with the usual girl problems and family trials. Then, on October 7, his five-year-old brother Jeffery falls, has a nosebleed that doesn't stop, and is diagnosed with leukemia. All hell breaks loose. Mrs. Alper's days and nights revolve around getting Jeffrey to his chemotherapy treatments, and Mr. Alper retreats into a shell, coming out only occasionally to weep over the mounting medical bills. Steven becomes the forgotten son, who throws himself into drumming, even as he quits doing his homework and tries to keep his friends from finding out about Jeffrey's illness. A story that could have morphed into melodrama is saved by reality, rawness, and the wit Sonnenblick infuses to Steven's first-person voice. The recriminations, cares, and nightmares that come with a cancer diagnosis are all here, underscored by vomiting, white blood cell counts, and chemotherapy ports. Yet, this is also about regrouping, solidarity, love, and hope. Most important for a middle-grade audience, Sonneblick shows that even in the midst of tragedy, life goes on, love can flower, and that the one thing you can always change is yourself. --Ilene Cooper<br><br>Kliatt 9/1/05<br>SONNENBLICK, Jordan. Drums, girls &amp; dangerous pie. Scholastic. 273p. Steven is in the 8th grade; he's a talented drummer who is part of an all-city jazz band, one of the youngest members. He's got a crush on a beautiful girl, a math whiz; but another girl seems more interested in him. That's the drums and girls part of the title. The "dangerous pie" is more difficult to explain, but it is something outrageous Steven's little brother Jeffrey says. Jeffrey is a precocious kindergarten student, who drives Steven nuts, but Steven doesn't realize at the beginning of the story just how important Jeffrey is in his life. Amidst the quite funny wisecracks and comments (Steven is considered a good musician with a wicked sense of humor) comes tragedy when Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia. Everything changes: to manage the cancer therapy, the mother has to quit her teaching job and thus the family income is cut in half; the father retreats into a non-communicative shell of grief; Steven is troubled and angry; little Jeffrey endures painful and nauseating treatments. Months later, everyone in the family is exhausted but learning to communicate, to pull together better. The school psychologist offers this wisdom to Steven: "Instead of agonizing about the things you can't change, why don't you try working on the things you can change?" Sonnenblick describes family life with great skill, and the frequently humorous anecdotes are entertaining, even when the basic story is grim. He manages to balance between horror and humor. This is the author's first novel, and he brings to it his knowledge of middle school students (he's been a middle school English teacher) and his understanding of how families work (he's married and the father of two children). Readers will love each and every character. Claire Rosser, KLIATT<br>BCCB November<br>Steven is attempting to survive the ordinarily painful life of an eighth-grader when his family gets hit with something out of the ordinary: his younger brother, five-year-old Jeffrey, is diagnosed with leukemia. Suddenly the Alper household is focused on Jeffrey's chemotherapy, Jeffrey's white-cell count, Jeffrey's temperature; meanwhile Steven's father, overwhelmed by the situation and the bills, checks out from the family, and Steven's school performance dwindles to nothing. Steven's narration reflects his credible seesaw between self-interest and protective panic: he's furious that no one in his family will be able to see him perform his great solo in concert, but he's devastated at the torment his annoying yet beloved baby brother must undergo. Less deft, however, is the plotting, which is inclined toward predictability (Steven realizes that his female friend is a more suitable girlfriend than the hot classmate he's been panting after); Jeffrey is often contrivedly rather convincingly drawn, and there's a jarring contrast between Stephen's heavily glib voice and the interpolated medical information he often conveys. The humor and earnestness of Steven's narration may nonetheless reassure young preteens who feel similarly helpless in the face of life's big and small challenges, <br><br>Horn Book<br>Jordan Sonnenblick Drums, Girls &amp; Dangerous Pie<br>273 pp. Scholastic 9/05 ISBN 0-439-75519-0 $16.99<br>(Middle School)<br>Sonnenblick's debut novel is a strikingly honest portrayal of a little boy's struggle with cancer as witnessed by his older brother. Eighth-grader Steven is mainly preoccupied with the drums he loves, the girls who ignore his existence, and the constant annoyance of five-year-old Jeffrey's presence (epitomized by the "dangerous pie" incident, in which Steven's prized drumsticks are used to stir a "zesty blend of coffee grounds, raw eggs and their smashed shells, Coke, uncooked bacon, <br>and three Matchbox racing cars"). Then Jeffrey is diagnosed with leukemia, and life departs from the expected. The novel wisely avoids <br>a resolution of Jeffrey's illness, focusing instead on the family's painful process of adjustment. A few unfortunate subplots-the predictable romantic triangle, the brief introduction and subsequent death of young leukemia patient Samantha-are more formula than innovation, and <br>the epilogue's sudden about-face toward optimism cheapens the anguish of previous chapters. Nevertheless, Sonnenblick's central characters resonate with sincerity as they navigate a precarious balancing act between daily life and hospital drama with heart and humor. Jeffrey is mischievous and endearing, but it is Steven, a convincing maelstrom of brotherly love, fear, and resentment, who will break readers' hearts. CLAIRE E. GROSS<br><br>PW Sonnenblick's insightful debut novel charts the way a talented 13-year-old drummer's life changes when his five-year-old brother, Jeffrey, is diagnosed with leukemia. Steven, whose story unfolds through his journals for English class, was the first drummer ever admitted into the All-City High School Band in the seventh grade, and this year, as an eighth grader, his future looks even brighter. After Jeffrey is diagnosed with cancer, his mother must spend more time taking Jeffrey to treatment and the family's finances begin to suffer; Steven takes refuge in the basement, practicing the drums for hours. The author perceptively records the struggle within Steven to lash out against his parents for feeling neglected and to feel compassion for his brother, as well as the normal adolescent concerns, including overlooking childhood friend Annette ("It's like she's figured out how to play [piano] like Beethoven and Thelonious Monk but hasn't quite mastered the art of being a girl yet"), who clearly has a crush on him, in favor of unattainable girl-next-door Renee. The journal structure is not always entirely believable, but Steven's thoughts and feelings are (after his mother returns from one of Jeffrey's treatments, Steven has an epiphany: "I realized without any shadow of a doubt that she would have done the same for me"). Readers may well feel inspired by the teen's gradual growth over the course of the novel, and drummers especially will enjoy this insider's view. Ages 12-up.

It provides an introduction&#x2015;written in clear, reader-friendly language&#x2015;to issues that arise at every stage in the practice of architecture. For architects starting or building their own practice: Why do I need a written agreement with my clients? Why do I need insurance? How do I organize my firm? For seasoned architects considering retirement: How do I transfer ownership in my company? How can I benefit from the good will I helped to build? For students who want to learn more about the practicalities of starting out: Why is it important to have a license? Isn&#x2019;t it enough to have a degree in architecture? What are my rights as an employee? It also addresses the perennial questions that concern architects: How do I protect myself from being sued? How do I protect my intellectual property rights in my work? and much more.<br><br><em>Law for Architects</em> identifies the legal issues that lurk in every corner of your design practice and helps you figure out what questions you need to ask.</p><p><b>Robert F.

He has studied with President Kennedy&#39;s famous pain specialist, Hans Kraus, M.D., and Lawrence S. Sonkin, Ph.D., renowned endocrinologist at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.Dr. Starr has written clear and understandable explanation of why so many people today are suffering from hypothyroidism, despite normal blood test that throw their doctors off the track. Having successfully treated several thousand type 2 hypothyroid patients myself over 23 years practice and watching them return to normal health, I applaud Dr. Starr s work which will hopefully reach many of those who are suffering so they can get help. His in-depth research and discussion of how environmental toxins can interfere with thyroid hormones is groundbreaking and enlightening for us all. Bravo Mark! --Robban Sica, M.D.<br><br>I believe everyone needs to review Mark Starr s book. He has a vital message to share about the many people who do not realize they have low thyroid, because standard thyroid tests do not show it. Mark Starr s dedication to research, and his devoted study with the old masters, have made him an international expert on thyroid and iodine. ---- Garry Gordon, M.D., D.O., M.D.(H)<br><br> --Garry Gordon, M.D., D.O., M.D.(H)<br><br>An astonishing book revealing the cause and successful treatment for the plague of illnesses affecting western civilization; including obesity, heart attacks, depression, diabetes, strokes, headaches, chronic fatigue, and many more. <p>In Dr. Starr's description of Type 2 Hypothyroidism, he presents overwhelming evidence showing a majority of Americans suffer this illness, which is due to environmental and hereditary factors. Laboratory testing used to diagnose hypothyroidism is completely inadequate, and current treatment for hypothyroidism is ineffective. Groundbreaking research shows how persistent environmental toxins prevent thyroid and other hormones from working properly.

Words like "judgment," "faith," "dogma," "salvation," "sinner"&#x2014;even "Christ"&#x2014;formed what she called her "scary vocabulary," words that had become so codified or abstract that their meanings were all but impenetrable. She found she had to wrestle with them and make them her own before they could confer their blessings and their grace. Blending history, theology, storytelling, etymology, and memoir, Norris uses these words as a starting point for reflection, and offers a moving account of her own gradual conversion. She evokes a rich spirituality rooted firmly in the chaos of everyday life&#x2014;and offers believers and doubters alike an illuminating perspective on how we can embrace ancient traditions and find faith in the contemporary world.</p><p>"Our ridiculously fallible language becomes a lesson in how God's grace works despite and even through our human frailty. We will never get the words exactly right. There will always be room for imperfection, for struggle, growth and change. And this is as it should be." With observations like this one, Kathleen Norris, author of <i>Dakota</i> and <i>The Cloister Walk</i>, has again provided a salutary corrective for contemporary Christians in <i>Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith</i>. The book is about how she learned to use religious words, such as "incarnation," "idolatry," and "evangelism." Norris is a feminist, a theological conservative, a sophisticate, and a country bumpkin. And she's one of the few living Christian writers who can be described as truly great.9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Functional Anatomy of the Pelvis and the Sacroiliac Joint: A Practical Guide</h2><p>This step-by-step guide for assessing the pelvis and sacroiliac joint by respected bodywork specialist John Gibbons explores all aspects of this crucial area of the body and how it links within the kinetic chain system.

A brief biography of each person, with highlights from their travels, accompanies high-quality illustrations: not only landscapes and wildlife but also portraits of long-vanished people, architecture, and customs, plus journal ephemera-sure to please sketchbook lovers. Most predate the mid-20th century, so predictably, few women and even fewer nonwhite artists are featured; issues of colonialism and appropriation are touched on, but these are not in-depth studies.

O&#39;Higgins paints her pre-Castro Cuban childhood in idyllic colors and calls a lost world to life. Family photographs add to the sweet, personal feel. However, while the essays and notes benefit from intimate detail, the recipes do not: Many feel like a-pinch-of-this-a-pinch-of-that attempts to nail down techniques that are second nature to the author. For example, directions for fried plantains instruct, &#34;Fry the plantain slices until they are almost black but not burned&#34; without giving any idea of how much time that will take - a problem for novice plantain cookers. Variety apparently has never been the spice of life in Cuba: Many of these are more or less similar recipes for the same dish. There are three different black-bean recipes and four for cooking rice, and that&#39;s only in the chapter on rice and beans. Another section gives 14 rice entrees, most with similar seasonings. O&#39;Higgins warns that Cuban desserts are achingly sweet (because sugar production was the backbone of the Cuban economy, consuming it came to be considered a patriotic act), and she is not kidding. A light eight-by-eight-inch sponge cake is drowned in a cup of port and more than two cups of a supersweet lime-cinnamon syrup. Good reading, bad eating. (Kirkus Reviews)When reading de O'Higgins's first cookbook, evocative prose seems to bring a distant Cuba back to life. Thanks to a lifelong love of Cuban food and devotion to her extended family, O'Higgins never lost touch with her Caribbean roots: she was raised there in the 1920s and '30s. With a sensibility that is responsive to both the flavors of food and the feelings that accompany meals remembered, the writer lets readers understand the myriad of influences that have formed Cuban cuisine. From her Catalan grandmother came recipes for cocido and sopa de ajos-classic Spanish soups. From her father, sportsman and bon vivant, came recipes for rabbit stews and lisa frita, or black mullet fish, pan-fried in olive oil and lime juice. Dried shrimp, a staple of the Chinese immigrants who settled in Cuba, makes a Cuban-style fried rice when blended with saffron, Valencia rice and pimentos. The 150 recipes O'Higgins collected and tested are clear and accessible, with prefaces that both entertain and inform the cook, making the book a worthwhile addition to the cookbook lover's library.

She lives in Westfield, Massachusets. &nbsp;Grade 5-9-- New York City youngster Daniel Garvey is around 11 when the Depression begins. At first he doesn't notice it much, but as the years go by, he sees the toll first in his neighborhood, as friends' families are evicted, and then in his own family. His father, out of work, takes to the road to find employment, and Daniel is left in charge of his expecting, ailing mother and his baby sister. Things go from bad to worse, until the family is rescued by someone who, at first blush, appears to be worse off than they. This differs from Pieter Van Raven's A Time of Troubles (Scribners, 1990) in that it deals with an eastern metropolitan population, not migrant workers. Less derivative than Van Raven's book, it also presents a view of the Depression that, if no less desperate, is less bleak. Daniel is an engaging protagonist who goesthrough numerous rites of passage familiar to young teens--first girlfriend, shaving, and the sudden realization that he is taller than his mother. He must also come to terms with his father's death and mother's remarriage. If it all works out a trifle too smoothly, the story still imparts the flavor of the time, and the strong plot line and numerous interesting supporting characters will hold readers' attention. --Ann Welton, Univ .

Burch explains how to use weather charts and how to interpret GRIB forecasts--including a discussion of their values and drawbacks. He discusses how to compare various computer models, discusses new and existing onboard technology and record keeping, and provides comprehensive lists of weather resources, and much more.&nbsp;The book fills a serious void in the literature.

You will be enriched along the way!" <b>-- Roger Jones, Director, Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation, Powerboater, sailor, and pilot.</b><br><br>The problem with teaching marine weather is the same problem as celestial navigation: How do you demonstrate a three-dimensional concept so that the recipient can visualize it? A book on marine weather represents a daunting subject, but once again David Burch has delivered a book that can be managed by expert and novice alike.<br><br>The chapter "Strong Wind Systems" exemplifies Burch's pragmatic yet encyclopedic approach to difficult subjects. For the sailor who wants to take a few rules of thumb for execution on the water, Burch offers a set of 12 steps for managing squalls at sea. For the more advanced, he provides elaborate diagrams of cloud profiles, tables of percentages and a detailed description of how to better understand forecast modeling. The same is true of the chapter "Working with Weather Maps," which starts with a description on under-standing surface maps and then moves into a detailed description of 500-mb weather maps, which show characteristics of wind at about 18,000 feet.<br><br>Why is this important? Burch explains: "The ultimate wind we feel on the surface depends on what is taking place up here with these winds aloft: how fast it is, whether it is rising or sinking, whether it is diverging or converging, as well as which specific direction the flow is proceeding across the globe, and how this pattern might be changing with time."<br>Burch's particular genius is to convey how and why context matters in understanding and predicting weather conditions at sea.

He had hacked his way through jungles, stared down bears and climbed mountains. But, one spot on the map called out to him irresistibly. Cutting through the forbidding landscape of the Hudson Bay Lowlands is a river no hunter, no explorer, has left any record of paddling. It was this river that Shoalts was obsessively determined to explore.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>What Shoalts discovered as he paddled downriver appeared in no satellite imagery or map: a series of waterfalls that could easily have killed him. Just as astonishing was the media reaction when he got back to civilization.

Shoalts had proved that the world is bigger than we think.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Gripping and often poetic, <i>Alone Against the North</i> is a classic adventure story of single-minded obsession, physical hardship, and the restless sense of wonder that every explorer has in common.

Herself the pupil of the great Manuel Garcia the Second and the associate of the unsurpassable divas of the middle nineteenth century, she also linked the traditional bel canto teaching method to the beginning of the twentieth century. Early in her career her work was praised enthusiastically by Rossini, who was for a time officially in charge of voice training in France; and toward the end of her career she prepared such superstars as Melba, Calv�, Eames, Aida, and others.<br>This volume embodies Madame Marchesi's "vocal alphabet," or basic instructions and exercises that formed the voices of her great pupils. An introductory text discusses breathing, attack, registers, and similar matters, while the remainder of the book contains many exercises that teach voice management and projections.<br>Marchesi's book is today even more important than when it first appeared, for it offers the basis for a construction of the bel canto training system. At the time the book appeared, the bel canto system had gone out of fashion in favor of more modern schools that seemed to offer more rapid maturation, voice volume, and dramatics. Today, a more realistic reevaluation has revealed that the bel canto system gave the singer much longer performing life, a more pleasing voice, and far greater musical ability. As Philip Miller states in his introduction, "a solidity, a sure technical mastery, an even scale with no register break . . . strong, even and secure trills, their coloratura masterly." In addition, the resurgence of interest in early-nineteenth-century opera renders a work like Marchesi's indispensable to the modern singer.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Burnt Offerings (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 7)</h2><p>Anita Blake is a vampire hunter.

Unfortunately, the director's focus on his live audience works better for them than for his audiobook listeners, who may experience moments of confusion.

I can&#x2019;t rightly remember now why we went to this specific town, but I think some young Danish backpackers had recommended it to us. In any case, after the loud, dirty train journey, there had been a long, loud, dirty bus ride. The bus had finally dropped us off in a staggeringly beautiful place that teetered on the border with China&#x2014;remote and verdant and wild. We found a hotel and when I stepped out alone to explore the town, to try to shake the stiffness of travel out of my legs, the little girl approached me. </p><p>She was twelve years old, I would learn later, but tinier than any American twelve-year-old I&#x2019;d ever met. She was exceptionally beautiful. Her skin was dark and healthy, her hair glossy and braided, her compact body all sturdy and confident in a short woolen tunic. Though it was summertime and the days were sultry, her calves were wrapped in brightly colored wool leggings. Her feet tapped restlessly in plastic Chinese sandals. She had been hanging around our hotel for some time&#x2014;I had spotted her when we were checking in&#x2014;and now, when I stepped </p><p>out of the place alone, she approached me full-on. </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; she asked. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Liz. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mai,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and I can write it down for you so you can learn how to spell it properly.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You certainly speak good English,&#x201d; I complimented her. </p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;Of course. I practice often with tourists. Also, I speak Vietnamese, Chinese, and some Japanese.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I joked. &#x201c;No French?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Un peu,&#x201d; she replied with a sly glance. Then she demanded, &#x201c;Where are you from, Liz?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m from America,&#x201d; I said. Then, trying to be funny, since obviously she was from right there, I asked, &#x201c;And where are you from, Mai?&#x201d; </p><p>She immediately saw my funny and raised it. &#x201c;I am from my mother&#x2019;s belly,&#x201d; she replied, instantly causing me to fall in love with her. </p><p>Indeed, Mai was from Vietnam, but I realized later she would never have called herself Vietnamese. She was Hmong&#x2014;a member of a small, proud, isolated ethnic minority (what anthropologists call &#x201c;an original people&#x201d;) who inhabit the highest mountain peaks of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and China. Kurdish-like, the Hmong have never really belonged to any of the countries in which they live. They remain some of the world&#x2019;s most spectacularly independent people&#x2014;nomads, storytellers, warriors, natural-born anticonformists, and a terrible bane to any nation that has ever tried to control them. </p><p>To understand the unlikelihood of the Hmong&#x2019;s continued existence on this planet you have to imagine what it would be like if, for instance, the Mohawk were still living in upstate New York exactly as they had for centuries, dressing in traditional clothing, speaking their own language, and absolutely refusing to assimilate. Stumbling on a Hmong village like this one, then, in the early years of the twenty-first century is an anachronistic wonder. Their culture provides a vanishingly rare window into an older version of the human experience. All of which is to say, if you want to know what your family was like four thousand years ago, they were probably something like the Hmong. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Mai,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Would you like to be my translator today?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she asked. </p><p>The Hmong are a famously direct people, so I laid it out directly: &#x201c;I need to talk to some of the women in your village about their marriages.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she demanded again. </p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m getting married soon, and I would like some advice.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re too old to be getting married,&#x201d; Mai observed, kindly. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, my boyfriend is old, too,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fifty-five years old.&#x201d; </p><p>She looked at me closely, let out a low whistle, and said, &#x201c;Well. Lucky him.&#x201d; </p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure why Mai decided to help me that day. Curiosity? Boredom? The hope that I would pass her some cash? (Which, of course, I did.) But regardless of her motive, she did agree. Soon enough, after a steep march over a nearby hillside, we arrived at Mai&#x2019;s stone house, which was tiny, soot-darkened, lit only by a few small windows, and nestled in one of the prettiest river valleys you could ever imagine. Mai led me inside and introduced me around to a group of women, all of them weaving, cooking, or cleaning. Of all the women, it was Mai&#x2019;s grandmother whom I found most immediately intriguing. She was the laughingest, happiest, four-foot-tall toothless granny I&#x2019;d ever seen in my life. What&#x2019;s more, she thought me hilarious. Every single thing about me seemed to crack her up beyond measure. She put a tall Hmong hat on my head, pointed at me, and laughed. She stuck a tiny Hmong baby into my arms, pointed at me, and laughed. She draped me in a gorgeous Hmong textile, pointed at me, and laughed. </p><p>I had no problem with any of this, by the way. I had long ago learned that when you are the giant, alien visitor to a remote and foreign culture it is sort of your job to become an object of ridicule. It&#x2019;s the least you can do, really, as a polite guest. Soon more women&#x2014;neighbors and relations&#x2014;poured into the house. They also showed me their weavings, stuck their hats on my head, crammed my arms full of their babies, pointed at me, and laughed. </p><p>As Mai explained, her whole family&#x2014;almost a dozen of them in total&#x2014;lived in this one-room home. Everyone slept on the floor together. The kitchen was on one side and the wood stove for winter was on the other side. Rice and corn were stored in a loft above the kitchen, while pigs, chickens, and water buffalo were kept close by at all times. There was only one private space in the whole house and it wasn&#x2019;t much bigger than a broom closet. This, as I learned later in my reading, was where the newest bride and groom in any family were allowed to sleep alone together for the first few months of their marriage in order to get their sexual explorations out of the way in private. After that initial experience of privacy, though, the young couple joins the rest of the family again, sleeping with everyone else on the floor for the rest of their lives. </p><p>&#x201c;Did I tell you that my father is dead?&#x201d; Mai asked as she was showing me around. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;When did it happen?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Four years ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How did he die, Mai?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He died,&#x201d; she said coolly, and that settled it. Her father had died of death. The way people used to die, I suppose, before we knew very much about why or how. &#x201c;When he died, we ate the water buffalo at his funeral.&#x201d; At this memory, her face flashed a complicated array of emotions: sadness at the loss of her father, pleasure at the remembrance of how good the water buffalo had tasted. </p><p>&#x201c;Is your mother lonely?&#x201d; </p><p>Mai shrugged. </p><p>It was hard to imagine loneliness here. Just as it was impossible to imagine where in this crowded domestic arrangement you might find the happier twin sister of loneliness: <i>privacy</i>. Mai and her mother lived in constant closeness with so many people. I was struck&#x2014;not for the first time in my years of travel&#x2014;by how isolating contemporary American society can seem by comparison. Where I come from, we have shriveled down the notion of what constitutes &#x201c;a family unit&#x201d; to such a tiny scale that it would probably be unrecognizable <i>as </i> a family to anybody in one of these big, loose, enveloping Hmong clans. You almost need an electron microscope to study the modern Western family these days. What you&#x2019;ve got are two, possibly three, or maybe sometimes four people rattling around together in a giant space, each person with her own private physical and psychological domain, each person spending large amounts of the day completely separated from the others. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to suggest here that everything about the shrunken modern family unit is necessarily bad. Certainly women&#x2019;s lives and women&#x2019;s health improve whenever they reduce the number of babies they have, which is a resounding strike against the lure of bustling clan culture. Also, sociologists have long known that incidences of incest and child molestation increase whenever so many relatives of different ages live together in such close proximity. In a crowd so big, it can become diffi cult to keep track of or defend individuals&#x2014;not to mention individuality. </p><p>But surely something has been lost, as well, in our modern and intensely private, closed-off homes. Watching the Hmong women interact with each other, I got to wondering whether the evolution of the ever smaller and ever more nuclear Western family has put a particular strain on modern marriages. In Hmong society, for instance, men and women don&#x2019;t spend all that much time together. Yes, you have a spouse. Yes, you have sex with that spouse. Yes, your fortunes are tied together. Yes, there might very well be love. But aside from that, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lives are quite firmly separated into the divided realms of their gender-specific tasks. Men work and socialize with other men; women work and socialize with other women. Case in point: there was not a single man to be found anywhere that day around Mai&#x2019;s house. Whatever the men were off doing (farming, drinking, talking, gambling) they were doing it somewhere else, alone together, separated from the universe of the women. If you are a Hmong woman, then, you don&#x2019;t necessarily expect your husband to be your best friend, your most intimate confidant, your emotional advisor, your intellectual equal, your comfort in times of sorrow. Hmong women, instead, get a lot of that emotional nourishment and support from other women&#x2014;from sisters, aunties, mothers, grandmothers. A Hmong woman has many voices in her life, many opinions and emotional buttresses surrounding her at all times. Kinship is to be found within arm&#x2019;s reach in any direction, and many female hands make light work, or at least lighter work, of the serious burdens of living. </p><p>At last, all the greetings having been exchanged and all the babies having been dandled and all the laughter having died down into politeness, we all sat. With Mai as our translator, I began by asking the grandmother if she would please tell me about Hmong wedding ceremonies. </p><p>It&#x2019;s all quite simple, the grandmother explained patiently. Before a traditional Hmong wedding, it is required that the groom&#x2019;s family come and visit the bride&#x2019;s house, so the families work out a deal, a date, a plan. A chicken is always killed at this time in order to make the families&#x2019; ghosts happy. Once the wedding date arrives, a good many pigs are killed. A feast is prepared and relatives come from every village to celebrate. Both the families chip in to cover expenses. There is a procession to the wedding table, and a relative of the groom will always carry an umbrella. </p><p>At this point, I interrupted to ask what the umbrella signified, but the question brought some confusion. Confusion, perhaps, over what the word &#x201c;signifies&#x201d; signifies. The umbrella is the umbrella, I was told, and it is carried because umbrellas are always carried at weddings. That is why, and that is that, and so it has always been. </p><p>Umbrella-related questions thereby resolved, the grandmother went on to explain the traditional Hmong marital custom of kidnapping. This is an ancient custom, she said, though it is much less in practice these days than it was in the past. Still, it does exist. Brides&#x2014; who are sometimes consulted beforehand about their kidnapping and sometimes not&#x2014;are abducted by their potential grooms, who carry them by pony to their own families&#x2019; homes. This is all strictly organized and is permitted only on certain nights of the year, at celebrations after certain market days. (You can&#x2019;t just kidnap a bride any old time you want. There are <i>rules</i>.) The kidnapped girl is given three days to live in the home of her captor, with his family, in order to decide whether or not she would like to marry this fellow. Most of the time, the grandmother reported, the marriage proceeds with the girl&#x2019;s consent. On the rare occasion that the kidnapped potential bride doesn&#x2019;t embrace her captor, she is allowed to return home to her own family at the end of the three days, and the whole business is forgotten. Which sounded reasonable enough to me, as far as kidnappings go. </p><p>Where our conversation did turn peculiar for me&#x2014;and for all of us in the room&#x2014;was when I tried to get the grandmother to tell me the story of her own marriage, hoping to elicit from her any personal or emotional anecdotes about her own experience with matrimony. The confusion started immediately, when I asked the old woman, &#x201c;What did you think of your husband, the first time you ever met him?&#x201d; </p><p>Her entire wrinkled face arranged itself into a look of puzzlement. Assuming that she&#x2014;or perhaps Mai&#x2014;had misunderstood the question, I tried again: </p><p>&#x201c;When did you realize that your husband might be somebody you wanted to marry?&#x201d; </p><p>Again, my question was met with what appeared to be polite bafflement. &#x201c;Did you know that he was special right away?&#x201d; I tried once more. &#x201c;Or did you learn to like him over time?&#x201d; </p><p>Now some of the women in the room had started giggling nervously, the way you might giggle around a slightly crazy person&#x2014;which was, apparently, what I had just become in their eyes. </p><p>I backed up and tried a different tack: &#x201c;I mean, when did you first meet your husband?&#x201d; </p><p>The grandmother sorted through her memory a bit on that one, but couldn&#x2019;t come up with a definitive answer aside from &#x201c;long ago.&#x201d; It really didn&#x2019;t seem to be an important question for her. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, <i>where </i> did you first meet your husband?&#x201d; I asked, trying to simplify the matter as much as possible. </p><p>Again, the very shape of my curiosity seemed a mystery to the grandmother. Politely, though, she gave it a try. She had never particularly <i>met </i> her husband before she married him, she tried to explain. She&#x2019;d seen him around, of course. There are always a lot of people around, you know. She couldn&#x2019;t really remember. Anyway, she said, it is not an important question as to whether or not she knew him when she was a young girl. After all, as she concluded to the delight of the other women in the room, she certainly knows him now. </p><p>&#x201c;But when did you fall in love with him?&#x201d; I finally asked, point-blank. </p><p>The instant Mai translated this question, all the women in the room, except the grandmother, who was too polite, laughed aloud&#x2014;a spontaneous outburst of mirth, which they then all tried to stifle politely behind their hands. </p><p>You might think this would have daunted me. Perhaps it should have daunted me. But I persisted, following up their peals of laughter with a question that struck them as even more ridiculous: </p><p>&#x201c;And what do you believe is the secret to a happy marriage?&#x201d; I asked earnestly. </p><p>Now they all really did lose it. Even the grandmother was openly howling with laughter. Which was fine, right? As has already been established, I am always perfectly willing to be mocked in a foreign country for somebody else&#x2019;s entertainment. But in this case, I...</p></p><h2>Storm Warning (The 39 Clues)</h2><p>The end is near!

For two decades Drew Westen, professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University, has explored a theory of the mind that differs substantially from the more "dispassionate" notions held by most cognitive psychologists, political scientists, and economists&#x2014;and Democratic campaign strategists. The idea of the mind as a cool calculator that makes decisions by weighing the evidence bears no relation to how the brain actually works. When political candidates assume voters dispassionately make decisions based on "the issues," they lose. That's why only one Democrat has been re-elected to the presidency since Franklin Roosevelt&#x2014;and only one Republican has failed in that quest.<p> In politics, when reason and emotion collide, emotion invariably wins. Elections are decided in the marketplace of emotions, a marketplace filled with values, images, analogies, moral sentiments, and moving oratory, in which logic plays only a supporting role. Westen shows, through a whistle-stop journey through the evolution of the passionate brain and a bravura tour through fifty years of American presidential and national elections, why campaigns succeed and fail. The evidence is overwhelming that three things determine how people vote, in this order: their feelings toward the parties and their principles, their feelings toward the candidates, and, if they haven't decided by then, their feelings toward the candidates' policy positions.</p><p> Westen turns conventional political analyses on their head, suggesting that the question for Democratic politics isn't so much about moving to the right or the left but about moving the electorate. He shows how it can be done through examples of what candidates have said&#x2014;or could have said&#x2014;in debates, speeches, and ads. Westen's discoveries could utterly transform electoral arithmetic, showing how a different view of the mind and brain leads to a different way of talking with voters about issues that have tied the tongues of Democrats for much of forty years&#x2014;such as abortion, guns, taxes, and race. You can't change the structure of the brain. But you can change the way you appeal to it. And here's how...</p></p><p><b>Drew Westen</b> received his B.A. at Harvard, an M.A. in Social and Political Thought at the University of Sussex (England), and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at the University of Michigan, where he subsequently taught for six years. For several years he was Chief Psychologist at Cambridge Hospital and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. He is a commentator on NPR's "All Things Considered" and lives in Atlanta.Everyone likes to think that people vote rationally after having carefully considered a variety of policies and chosen the best ones. Sadly, that is not the case, says psychologist Drew Westen. He believes he has proven that voters respond emotionally and will subconsciously ignore facts and other information that contradict their selection or preference. Westen describes the psychology then gives examples of politicians who are successful in creating an emotional bond with voters and those who fail. Anthony Heald�s well-paced narration gives the listener time to digest the book�s complex ideas. His voice is strong and clear, and his diction is superb.

Amidst all this roiling partisan argument and confusing claims and counterclaims, there has never been a greater need for an impartial primer on the basics of the American political system. <br><br>This Very Short Introduction gives readers a concise, accessible, and sophisticated overview of the vital elements of American democracy, emphasizing both how these elements function, their historical origins, and how they have evolved into their present forms. Richard Valelly covers all facets of America's political system: the bicameral Congress and the place of the filibuster, the legislative-executive process, the role of the Supreme Court, political parties and democratic choice, bureaucracy, the partisan revival, and the political economy. He offers as well an original analysis of the evolution of the American presidency and a fascinating chapter on the effects of public polling on political decision-making and voter representation. Valelly shows that the American political system is, and always has been, very much a work in progress--unfolding within, and also constantly updating, an eighteenth-century constitutional framework. In a refreshingly balanced and judicious assessment, he explores the strengths of American democracy while candidly acknowledging both gaps in representation and the increasing income inequality have sparked protest and intense public discussion. Finally, Valelly considers the remarkable persistence, for more than two centuries, of the basic constitutional forms established in 1787, despite the dramatic social changes that have reshaped virtually all aspects of American life. <br><br> For anyone wishing to understand the nuts and bolts of how our political system works--and sometimes fails to work--this Very Short Introduction is the very best place to start. <br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library.

Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and <em>New York Times </em>subscriptions, you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club).<br><br>According to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company.<br><br>Consider Whatsapp, the internet-based messaging service that was purchased by Facebook for $19 billion. While other services bombarded users with invasive ads in order to fund a free messaging platform, Whatsapp offered a refreshingly private tool on a subscription platform, charging just $1 per year. Their business model enabled the kind of service that customers wanted and ensured automatic customers for years to come.<br><br>As Warrillow shows, subscriptions aren&#x2019;t limited to technology or media businesses. Companies in nearly any industry, from start-ups to the Fortune 500, from home contractors to florists, can build subscriptions into their business.<br><br>Warrillow provides the essential blueprint for winning automatic customers with one of the nine subscription business models, including: <ul> <li><strong>The Membership Website Model</strong>: Companies like The Wood Whisperer Guild, ContractorSelling.com, and DanceStudioOwner.com offer access to highly specialized, high quality information, recognizing that people will pay for good content. This model can work for any business with a tightly defined niche market and insider information.</li> <li><strong>The Simplifier Model</strong>: Companies like Mosquito Squad (pest control) and Hassle Free Homes (home maintenance) take a recurring task off your to-do list. Any business serving busy consumers can adopt this model not only to create a recurring revenue stream, but also to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-sell or bundle their services.</li> <li><strong>The Surprise Box Model</strong>: Companies like BarkBox (dog treats) and Standard Cocoa (craft chocolate) send their subscribers curated packages of goodies each month. If you can handle the logistics of shipping, giving customers joy in something new can translate to sales on your larger e-commerce site.</li> </ul> <br>This book also shows you how to master the psychology of selling subscriptions and how to reduce churn and provides a road map for the essential statistics you need to measure the health of your subscription business.<br><br>Whether you want to transform your entire business into a recurring revenue engine or just pick up an extra 5 percent of sales growth, <em>The Automatic Customer</em> will be your secret weapon.<br><strong><br>Table of Contents<br>Introduction<br></strong>PART ONE: SUBSCRIBERS ARE BETTER THAN CUSTOMERS<br>Chapter 1: The<br>New<br>500-Year-Old Business Model<br>Chapter 2: Why You Need Automatic Customers<br>PART TWO: THE NINE SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS MODELS<br>Chapter 3: The Membership Website Model<br>Chapter 4: The All-You-Can-Eat Library Model<br>Chapter 5: The Private Club Model<br>Chapter 6: The Front-of-the-Line Subscription Model<br>Chapter 7: The Consumables Model<br>Chapter 8: The Surprise Box Model<br>Chapter 9: The Simplifier Model<br>Chapter 10: The Network Model<br>Chapter 11: The Peace-of-Mind Model<br>PART THREE: YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS FIELD GUIDE<br>Chapter 12: The New Math<br>Chapter 13: The Cash Suck vs. The Cash Spigot<br>Chapter 14: The Psychology of Selling a Subscription<br>Chapter 15: Scaling Up<br>Chapter 16: Reflections</p><p><b>JOHN WARRILLOW</b>, the author of <i>Built to Sell</i>, is the founder of a subscription-based company called The Value Builder System&#x2122;, where advisers help company owners increase the value of their businesses. Before that he founded Warrillow &amp; Co., a subscription-based research business dedicated to helping Fortune 500 companies market to small business owners. A sought-after speaker and popular Inc.com columnist, he lives in Toronto, Canada.<p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>We had been running together for five months when Sacha announced he was leaving on a business trip to China. The timing could not have been worse; the marathon was just six weeks away, and we had come to rely on each other to stay motivated through the hardest part of our training schedule.</p><p>Now, at the height of our work, he was leaving for two weeks.</p><p>Since Sacha and I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to run together, we decided to egg each other on digitally. We agreed to text each other the results from our training run each day as a way to stay motivated. Sacha asked if, instead of texting, we could use a messaging service called WhatsApp.</p><p>I was used to texting using the standard service on my iPhone, so I wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to learn a new platform. I asked him why we couldn&#x2019;t just text the normal way.</p><p>Sacha replied that the phone company charges a relative fortune to text from China, and WhatsApp, instead of using the mobile networks, runs on the Internet and therefore doesn&#x2019;t require expensive mobile carrier fees. In fact, the only fee to use WhatsApp is a $1 per year subscription it charges after the first year.</p><p>We used WhatsApp to communicate while Sacha was in China, and eventually finished the marathon together, thanks in part to our WhatsApp-supported training regimen. It turns out that, in using WhatsApp, we were not alone. By early 2014, WhatsApp had acquired 450 million users and was adding a million users per day when Facebook announced it had acquired the company for $19 billion&#x2014;the largest acquisition of an Internet start-up in history.</p><p>Most of the other Internet-based messaging services at the time used an advertising model to monetize their users. They offered a free platform but bombarded users with cheesy ads in return. WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton wanted to offer a cleaner, more private messaging experience. Instead of selling advertising, they opted for the subscription business model.</p><p>A dollar a year as a subscription fee may not sound like much, but when you have 450 million users and are picking up a million users a day, $1 a year starts to add up. What&#x2019;s more, because WhatsApp doesn&#x2019;t try to be anything other than a subscription-based messaging platform, it doesn&#x2019;t need a lot of employees. In fact, at the time of its acquisition, it had just 55 people taking care of its 450 million subscribers.</p><p>WhatsApp won the $19 billion lottery not because its technology was better, or its people were any more caring, or its advertising was funnier. WhatsApp won, in large part, because it made its customers automatic. It chose the right business model for success by asking users to subscribe to its service.</p><p>This book will show you how to apply the subscription business model to your own business. When people think of subscriptions, they often think of cloud-based software, gaming, or media companies. While readers from those industries will benefit from this book, you can also apply the subscription business model to your company&#x2014;no matter what your size or industry. WhatsApp is only one example of how powerful automatic customers can be for the growth of your business.</p><p>I Screwed Up</p><p>The last time I wrote a book, I screwed up.</p><p>Called <i>Built to Sell: Creating a Business That Can Thrive Without You,</i> the book was designed to illustrate how to transform a successful business into a sellable one. In it, I touched briefly on the importance of having customers who repurchase from you on a regular schedule, but in hindsight, I should have dedicated at least half the book to recurring revenue.</p><p>In the years since <i>Built to Sell</i> was published, I&#x2019;ve come to see how important recurring revenue is in building a valuable, sellable company. These days I run a subscription business called The Sellability Score (SellabilityScore.com) that helps owners build valuable companies by examining the eight key drivers of sellability. Owners who achieve a Sellability Score of 80 or more out of a possible 100 garner offers that are 71% higher than the average.</p><p>The biggest factor in driving up your Sellability Score is the degree to which your company can run without you, the owner. That&#x2019;s a head scratcher for a lot of owners who are the best salesperson in their business. The secret is to build recurring revenue that brings in sales without having to resell the customer each month.</p><p>To appreciate the impact of recurring revenue on your company&#x2019;s value, you have to understand what buyers are buying when they acquire a business. Most owners want buyers to value their past achievements, such as last year&#x2019;s profits or an industry award they&#x2019;re proud of. In fact, it has been my experience that financial buyers are really buying only one thing when they purchase a company: a <i>future</i> stream of profits.</p><p>In the home security business, for example, companies have two forms of revenue. They receive <i>installation revenue</i> when they come to your home or office to install the keypad and wire things up, and they receive <i>monitoring revenue</i> in the form of the monthly payment for keeping an eye on things.</p><p>At SellabilityScore.com, we know from our analysis that when an acquirer buys a security business, it pays 75 cents for &#x201c;one-shot&#x201d; installation revenue and <i>$2 </i>for every dollar of monitoring revenue. Said another way, a security company with 100% monitoring revenue (the subscription aspect of such a business) is almost three times more valuable than a security business of the same size that has 100% installation revenue.</p><p>The same trend plays out across most industries. Accounting firms are valued based on their recurring fees. Financial planning practices trade based on how likely clients are to stay with the firm after the owner retires. IBM&#x2019;s stock moves up and down based on its recurring revenue from service contracts.</p><p>So recurring revenue makes your business a lot more valuable, and it also makes your company less stressful to run.</p><p>The Tyranny of Selling &amp; Doing</p><p>In 1997, I started Warrillow &amp; Co., a research company. We started out as a typical &#x201c;sell/do&#x201d; services business; our job was to cultivate relationships with people, listen to their problems, and try to come up with a solution. Each project was different, and we spent the majority of our time developing custom proposals, many of which were never accepted.</p><p>The company was profitable on paper but debilitatingly stressful to run. I hated the first day of each month because that was when all the dials turned back to zero and we had to scramble to find enough business to cover our overhead.</p><p>I remember distinctly the first time our fixed expenses crested $100,000 per month. I thought to myself, &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t sell anything this month, we still have $100,000 in expenses to cover!&#x201d;</p><p>The stress of having to re-create the business from scratch each month led me in search of a better model. I started to study other research companies, like Gartner and Forrester Research, that had successfully &#x201c;productized&#x201d; a service and, as a result, began experimenting with automating parts of our business.</p><p>Instead of doing &#x201c;one-shot&#x201d; research, we decided to offer the identical packages of information to a subscriber base of customers. Instead of doing custom proposals, we created a brochure about our offering and a standard proposal. Instead of getting paid 60 days after the project was complete, we charged up front for an annual subscription to our research.</p><p>The business became much less stressful to run. We went into each new month with revenue on the books, and we were no longer beholden to any one customer. In fact, we starting winning the world&#x2019;s largest companies as subscribers, including American Express, Apple, AT&amp;T, Bank of America, Dell, FedEx, Google, HP, IBM, MasterCard, Microsoft, Sprint, Visa, and Wells Fargo. Charging for our subscription up front also meant that after a while we had more cash than we knew what to do with. To top it off, we were growing at a rate of 25% a year and were quickly replacing the revenue from the one-shot projects we had left behind. Warrillow &amp; Co. was acquired by a public company in 2008.</p><p>You may be thinking, <i>That&#x2019;s nice, but it would never work in </i>my<i> industry or in </i>my<i> company</i>. Maybe&#x2014;especially if you cling to the standard industry practices of your category. But as you&#x2019;ll see, virtually every business&#x2014;from a start-up to a Fortune 500 company, from a home contractor to a manufacturer&#x2014;can create at least some recurring revenue if it is willing to jettison the old way of doing things to pioneer a new business model.</p><p>And companies that don&#x2019;t just might face competition from those that do. Increasingly, some of the smallest businesses in the world are facing crippling competition from the largest. The subscription economy has pitted small companies against big ones and suppliers against resellers, and has even made partners into enemies. The battle lines are being drawn, and I hope <i>The Automatic Customer</i> will be your secret weapon for winning in the subscription economy.</p><p>If you are someone who has a business that you would like to make a little more predictable, a little less stressful, and a whole lot more valuable, this book is for you. Whether you want to transform your entire business model or just pick up an extra 5% of automatic revenue, I hope you&#x2019;ll see yourself in the following pages.</p><p>What You&#x2019;ll Find Inside</p><p>The book is organized into three sections. Part One outlines the surprising truth about who is winning in the subscription economy, why companies like Apple and Amazon are transforming themselves into subscription businesses, and why virtually every venture-backed start-up has a recurring revenue model.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll also look at eight ways your business will be more valuable and less stressful after you adopt the subscription model. You&#x2019;ll learn how the subscription business model dramatically increases the average value of each of your customers, and how to smooth out demand in your company so that it matches your ability to fulfill it. We&#x2019;ll discuss why automatic customers buy more than one-shot customers and why subscription revenue is stickier than a one-time purchase.</p><p>Part Two is divided into minichapters on the nine subscription business models. As you&#x2019;ll see, you have a variety of choices when it comes to building a recurring revenue stream for your business. Whether you want to transform your entire business or just pick up a few thousand dollars of passive income, you&#x2019;ll get a ton of new ideas for applying the subscription model to your company.</p><p>The third and final section of <i>The Automatic Customer</i> gives you the blueprint for building your subscription business. We&#x2019;ll discuss a handful of key statistics that will define the viability of your subscription and highlight one ratio you must achieve in order to scale up. We&#x2019;ll look at the psychology of selling your subscription and how to overcome something I call &#x201c;subscription fatigue.&#x201d; Then we&#x2019;ll turn to financing the growth of your subscription business and explore whether you want to raise venture-capital funding, as WhatsApp and Dollar Shave Club did, or self-fund your growth, like FreshBooks and Mosquito Squad. Part Three ends with a discussion on scaling your subscription business.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s get started.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Subscribers Are Better than Customers</p><p>Why are Amazon, Apple, and many of the most promising Silicon Valley start-ups leveraging a subscription business model? In Part One we&#x2019;ll look at how automatic customers make your company more valuable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a whole lot more enjoyable to run.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Who Wins in the Subscription Economy?</p><p>Amazon has come a long way since its days of just hawking cheap books online. Of course, you can still buy books on the site, but today&#x2019;s Amazon will sell you everything from diapers to laundry detergent. Increasingly, it is digging deeper into our pockets through the subscription service called Amazon Prime.</p><p>Amazon Prime subscribers pay Amazon $99 a year in return for goodies like free streaming of thousands of movies and TV shows and free two-day shipping on most Amazon purchases. According to a 2013 report released by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, there are now approximately 16 million subscribers to Amazon Prime. As I write this, the folks at Morningstar estimate, since Amazon does not release the data publicly, that membership in Amazon Prime could swell to 25 million by 2017.</p><p>If you were to carve out Amazon Prime as a stand-alone business, it would already be a billion-dollar subscription company, but that severely underestimates the value of Prime to Amazon. Like many subscription models, Amazon Prime is a Trojan horse that is expanding the list of products consumers are willing to buy from Amazon and giving the eggheads in Seattle a mountain of customer data to sift through.</p><p>&#x201c;It was never about the $79,&#x201d; said Vijay Ravindran, who worked on the team that launched Prime at its original price of $79 per year. &#x201c;It was really about changing people&#x2019;s mentality so they wouldn&#x2019;t shop anywhere else.&#x201d;1</p><p>According to Morningstar, the average Prime member now spends $1,224 on Amazon purchases each year, compared with $505 for non-Prime customers.2 We cannot say Prime members spend that much more just <i>because</i> they are members, since presumably a lot of Amazon&#x2019;s best customers would have been attracted to the free shipping offer. However, this data seems to suggest that once someone becomes a Prime subscriber, they become even more loyal to Amazon. Further, Morningstar figures that after factoring in costs incurred for shipping and streaming content, the average Prime member yields Amazon $78 more per year in <i>profits</i> than the typical customer.</p><p>Given the positive impact Prime seems to have on customers&#x2019; buying behavior, some analysts have argued that Amazon should drop the fee for subscribing to Prime in order to grow the program even faster. But that thinking misses a key element of Amazon&#x2019;s strategy. When you pay $99 per year to become a member, you want to &#x201c;get your money&#x2019;s worth.&#x201d; Suddenly you start checking Amazon&#x2019;s pricing on annuity stream adjacent to your main business, you sorts of products, from paper towels to sneakers, with hopes of &#x201c;making back&#x201d; what you invested in the membership. Given Amazon&#x2019;s aggressive pricing and seemingly endless product selection, you can almost always find what you&#x2019;re looking for at a price that&#x2019;s lower than what you could find elsewhere. When you factor in free shipping, it becomes an easy decision to buy from Amazon.</p><p>Robbie Schwietzer, vice president of Amazon Prime from 2008 to 2013, summarized: &#x201c;In all my years here, I don&#x2019;t remember anything that has been as successful at getting customers to shop in new product lines.&#x201d;3</p><p>Through Prime, Amazon is competing head-to-head with the likes of Walmart and Target. Why should you care if three heavyweights are pounding it out for market supremacy? Because as customers buy a broader and broader collection of items from Amazon, Prime is cannibalizing the business of smaller companies too.</p><p>The other day I bought a pair of New Balance ...</p></p><h2>Songs for the Open Road: Poems of Travel and Adventure (Dover Thrift Editions: Poetry)</h2><p>Most of us, at one time or another, have experienced wanderlust.

In his backseat is a man with a gun in his hand&#x2015;a man who brazenly committed a crime in front of the Artemis Club, a rarefied art gallery-cum-casino, then jumped in and ordered Parsons to drive. As the criminal eventually escapes to Nairobi, Detective Superintendent Richard Jury comes across the case in the Saturday paper.</p><p> <br>Two days previously, Jury had met and instantly connected with one of the victims of the crime, a professor of astrophysics at Columbia and an expert gambler. Feeling personally affronted, Jury soon enlists Melrose Plant, Marshall Trueblood, and his whole gang of merry characters to contend with a case that takes unexpected turns into Tanzanian gem mines, a closed casino in Reno, Nevada, and a pub that only London&#x2019;s black cabbies, those who have &#x201c;the knowledge,&#x201d; can find. <i>The Knowledge</i> is prime fare from &#x201c;one of the most fascinating mystery writers today&#x201d; (<i>Houston Chronicle</i>).</p></p><p><b>Martha Grimes</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of more than thirty books, twenty-four of them featuring Richard Jury.

I was only getting a C in it, even though, in real life, I had been quite good at self-preservation. Over the past eleven months, my enemies had kidnapped me, shot at me, locked me in a room with a ticking bomb, and even tried to blow me up with missiles&#x2014;and yet I&#x2019;d survived each time. However, my instructors at the CIA&#x2019;s Academy of Espionage never seemed very impressed by the fact that I was still alive. They just kept giving me bad grades.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a big difference between running away and being able to defend yourself,&#x201d; my ASP instructor, Professor Simon, had explained, shortly before the call from the principal came. Professor Georgia Simon was in her fifties and looked like someone my mother would have played canasta with, but she was an incredible warrior, capable of beating three karate masters in a fight at once. &#x201c;So far, all you have done in the field is run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worked pretty well for me so far,&#x201d; I countered.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been lucky,&#x201d; Professor Simon said. And then she attacked me with a samurai sword.<br> <br>It was only a fake sword, but it was still daunting. (The academy had stopped using real swords a few years earlier, after a student had been literally disarmed in class.) I did my best to defend myself, but it was only twenty seconds before I was sprawled on the floor with Professor Simon standing over me, sword raised, ready to shish kabob my spleen.<br> <br>Which was all the more embarrassing, as it happened in front of the entire class. ASP took place in a large lecture hall. My fellow classmates were seated in tiers around me, watching me get my butt kicked by a woman four times my age.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pathetic,&#x201d; Professor Simon declared. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s D-grade work at best. Would anyone here like to show Mr. Ripley how a real agent defends himself?&#x201d;<br> <br>No one volunteered. My fellow second-year students weren&#x2019;t idiots; none of them wanted to be embarrassed like I had been. Or hurt. Luckily for them, at that moment, the announcement from the principal came over the school&#x2019;s public address system, distracting Professor Simon.<br> <br>There were plenty of other, far less outdated ways to deliver urgent messages to the classrooms at spy school, but the principal didn&#x2019;t know how to use any of them. In fact, he wasn&#x2019;t very good at using the PA system, either. There were a few seconds of fumbling noises, followed by the principal muttering, &#x201c;I can never remember which switch works this stupid thing. This darn system&#x2019;s a bigger pain in my rear than my hemorrhoids.&#x201d; Then he asked, &#x201c;Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Professor Simon sighed in a way that suggested she had even less respect for the principal than she had for me. &#x201c;Yes. We can hear you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; the principal replied. &#x201c;Is Benjamin Ripley in your class right now? I need to see him in my office right away.&#x201d;<br> <br>A chorus of &#x201c;ooohs&#x201d; rippled through the room: the universal middle-school response to realizing that someone else has just gotten in trouble.<br> <br>Professor Simon gave the class a warning glare and the &#x201c;ooohs&#x201d; stopped immediately. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send him right now,&#x201d; she replied. Then she looked down at me and said, &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;<br> <br>I leapt to my feet and hurried for the door, pausing only to snatch my backpack from my seat. Zoe Zibbell, one of my best friends, was in the next seat over. She looked at me inquisitively with her big green eyes, wanting to know if I knew why I&#x2019;d been summoned. I shrugged in return.<br> <br>Next to Zoe, Warren Reeves snickered at my misfortune. Warren didn&#x2019;t like me much; he had a crush on Zoe and saw me as competition, so he was always rooting for my downfall.<br> <br>I made a show of hustling out the door for Professor Simon&#x2014;and promptly slowed down the moment I was out of her sight. I was in no hurry to get to the principal&#x2019;s office.<br> <br>I had been summoned to the principal four other times, and it had always been bad news: Previously, the principal had sent me to solitary confinement, placed me on probation, informed me that my summer vacation plans were cancelled in favor of mandatory wilderness training&#x2014;and expelled me from school. (I&#x2019;d been reinstated, however.) So I dawdled, wondering what trouble lay in store for me this time.<br> <br>I exited Bushnell Hall and entered Hammond Quadrangle on my way to the Nathan Hale Administration Building. It was the week after Thanksgiving. Fall had been mild and beautiful in Washington, DC, but now winter had arrived with a vengeance. Frigid winds were stripping the trees bare of leaves, and a crust of icy snow carpeted the ground.<br> <br>As I meandered across the quad, my phone buzzed with a text. It was from Erica Hale:<br> <br>stop dawdling and get your butt up here. we&#x2019;re waiting.<br> <br>I stared up at the gothic Hale Building, wondering if Erica was watching me&#x2014;or if she simply knew me well enough to presume I was dawdling. Either was a likely possibility.<br> <br>Erica was only a fourth-year student, but she was easily the best spy-in-training at school. However, she&#x2019;d had a head start on the rest of us: She was a legacy. The very building I was heading toward was named after her family. Her ancestors had all been spies for the United States, going back to Nathan Hale himself&#x2014;and her grandfather, Cyrus, had been teaching her the family business since she was born. When I&#x2019;d been learning how to assemble Legos, she&#x2019;d been learning how to assemble semiautomatic machine guns. Blindfolded.<br> <br>I picked up my pace, hurrying toward the Hale Building. If Erica was waiting for me with the principal, that probably meant I wasn&#x2019;t in trouble. Plus, I was excited to see her.<br> <br>I had a massive crush on Erica Hale. She was the most beautiful, intelligent, and dangerous girl I&#x2019;d ever met in my life. I knew Erica didn&#x2019;t like me nearly as much as I liked her, but the fact that she liked me even a little was a big deal. Erica regarded most of her fellow students&#x2014;and professors&#x2014;with complete disinterest. As though they were rocks. And not even pretty rocks. Boring, gray rocks. Gravel. Even though her text to me had been curt and cold, it was still a text from her, which was more human contact than Erica usually parceled out. There were plenty of guys at school who would have killed to get a text from Erica Hale.<br> <br>I burst into the Hale Building and took the stairs up to the fifth floor two at a time. The security agents stationed there quickly waved me through to the restricted area. &#x201c;Come right on in, Mr. Ripley,&#x201d; one said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been expecting you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stopped and spread my arms and legs for the standard frisking, but the second guard shook her head. &#x201c;No need for that. They want to see you ASAP.&#x201d; She pointed me toward a door.<br> <br>This was a different door than the usual one for the principal&#x2019;s office. A piece of paper was taped to it. It said PIRNCIPAL. Given the misspelling, I figured the principal had written it himself.<br> <br>The principal was very likely the least intelligent person in the entire intelligence community. We had a lot of decent teachers at school, most of whom had been decent spies earlier in their careers. Meanwhile, the principal had been a horrible spy. He had failed on every single mission. No one wanted him teaching anyone anything, so he was made an administrator instead. He mostly handled paperwork that no one else wanted to deal with.<br> <br>The principal wasn&#x2019;t using his normal office because I&#x2019;d blown it up by firing a mortar round into it. (It was an accident.) The damage had been extensive, and since the government was in charge of the repairs, they were taking a very long time. The official completion date was set for three years in the future, but even that was probably optimistic; my dormitory had been waiting to have its septic system replaced since before the Berlin Wall fell. In the meantime, the principal had been moved down the hall.<br> <br>Into a closet.<br> <br>It was a rather large closet, but it was still a closet. Given the pungent smell of ammonia, I presumed that, until recently, cleaning supplies had been stored there. Instead of a nice big, imposing desk, the principal now had a card table. He sat behind it in a creaky folding chair, glowering at me from beneath the world&#x2019;s most horrendous hairpiece. It looked like a raccoon had died on his head. And then been run over by a truck. The closet would have been crowded enough with only the principal and me, but three other people were crammed in there as well, waiting for me. All of them were Hales.<br> <br>Erica stood beside her father, Alexander, and her grandfather, Cyrus.<br> <br>Alexander Hale had been an extremely respected spy for years, despite the fact that he was a complete fraud. The Agency had finally caught on and kicked him out, but he had subsequently proved himself on an unsanctioned mission and been reinstated. Now he was back to his usual debonair self, wearing a tailored three-piece suit with a perfectly folded handkerchief and a crisply knotted tie.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Cyrus Hale was the real deal, as good a spy as there was in the CIA, even though he was in his seventies. He&#x2019;d been retired but had recently reactivated himself. Cyrus didn&#x2019;t bother with fancy suits, which he considered impractical. Instead, he wore warm-ups, sneakers, and a fanny pack; he looked like he was about to go walk around the mall for exercise.<br> <br>Erica wore her standard black outfit, her standard utility belt, and her standard bored expression. She barely glanced at me as I came in. &#x201c;Nice of you to finally join us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry I kept you waiting.&#x201d; I realized the closet didn&#x2019;t have a window. Which meant Erica hadn&#x2019;t seen me dawdling. She&#x2019;d simply known I was doing it.<br> <br>&#x201c;No worries, Benjamin,&#x201d; Alexander said cheerfully. &#x201c;I just got here myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not exactly something to be proud of,&#x201d; Cyrus told him disapprovingly. &#x201c;Seeing as you were supposed to be here half an hour ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alexander winced, the way he usually did when his father dressed him down, then tried to save face. &#x201c;I was doing some important prep work for this mission.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What mission?&#x201d; I asked. In the cramped closet, there was barely room to move. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re being activated!&#x201d; Alexander announced excitedly.<br> <br>Cyrus grimaced, as though Alexander had said something he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The principal snapped to his feet, flabbergasted, obviously unaware of this news. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re activating this little twerp? For a real mission?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t make much sense for us to activate him for a fake mission, now, would it?&#x201d; Cyrus asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, he can&#x2019;t go!&#x201d; the principal declared childishly. &#x201c;He blew up my office!&#x201d;<br> <br>Cyrus exhaled slowly, trying to be patient. &#x201c;As I have explained to you multiple times, that was not entirely Ripley&#x2019;s doing. It was a setup to make our enemies at SPYDER believe that he had actually been expelled so that they&#x2019;d recruit him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He nearly killed me!&#x201d; the principal protested, immune to Cyrus&#x2019;s logic. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad enough that I had to take him back here as a student&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He was instrumental in thwarting SPYDER&#x2019;s plans,&#x201d; Alexander pointed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but now you&#x2019;re going to send him out into the field again?&#x201d; the principal railed on. &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t even been at this academy a year yet! He&#x2019;s not qualified for the field!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is,&#x201d; said Cyrus. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s proved it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; the principal began.<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t really matter if you agree with me on this,&#x201d; Cyrus interrupted. &#x201c;Because the chief of the CIA agrees with me. And he&#x2019;s the one who authorizes the missions, not you. The only reason we&#x2019;re even having this meeting here is that, as the principal of this institution, you officially have to be informed when students are being sent into the field.&#x201d;<br> <br>If there had been anyplace to sit down in the office, I would have sat down. It was surprising enough to hear that I was being activated by the CIA. But I was completely floored to hear Cyrus defend me. Cyrus didn&#x2019;t give out praise easily. In fact, it was a good bet that he&#x2019;d never given any to Alexander at all.<br> <br>The principal sank back into his folding chair, glowering even harder at me.<br> <br>I tried to avoid his gaze, shifting my attention to Erica instead. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being activated too?&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica arched an eyebrow at me but didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;And your grandfather just said &#x2018;students&#x2019; were being activated. So it&#x2019;s not only me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excellent deductive work, as usual!&#x201d; Alexander pronounced, patting me on the back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Erica will also be with you on assignment, as will my father and I!&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change. I had no idea if she was pleased with any of this or not. She might as well have just been told she needed a root canal.<br> <br>I was pleased, though. Even more than pleased; the idea of being on assignment with Erica was thrilling. In the first place, there was no one I trusted more. Second, it meant I now had an excuse to spend a lot of time with her.<br> <br>In theory, I should have had plenty of other excuses to spend time with Erica, seeing as we both went to the same top-secret boarding school. But Erica could be as cold and distant as Antarctica. While the other kids at school bonded over pickup games of capture the flag or James Bond movie marathons, Erica kept to herself. Even though I was considered her closest friend on campus, that didn&#x2019;t mean much. A few months before, at the end of our last mission, when we were both doped up on painkillers after nearly being vaporized by a missile, Erica had said a few nice things to me and held my hand. But since then she had behaved as though that had never even happened. There had been weeks when she hadn&#x2019;t so much as glanced at me.<br> <br>So I was excited for an excuse to hang out with her. Even one where my life might be in danger. As far as I was concerned, it was worth the risk.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the mission?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Cyrus produced a sealed manila envelope from the inner pocket of his warm-up jacket and handed it to me. It was labeled OPERATION SNOW BUNNY and stamped FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. My heart leapt. Getting an honest-to-God &#x201c;For Your Eyes Only&#x201d; manila envelope in spy school was like being named king of homecoming in regular school.<br> <br>I broke open the seal and found several photographs inside. They were extremely grainy, as though they&#x2019;d been taken from a long distance away with a telephoto lens. The first one was of a Chinese man with close-cropped hair wearing sunglasses.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is Leo Shang,&#x201d; Cyrus told me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s one of the richest men in China. Worth billions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he do?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have no idea,&#x201d; Cyrus admitted. &#x201c;The truth is, we know almost nothing about him: where he grew up, how much education he has, what he owns. He simply appeared on the scene five years ago, loaded with cash.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica shifted closer to me to get a better look at the photos. As usual, she smelled incredible, a combination of lilacs and gunpowder. She stared at the pictures in a way that suggested she&#x2019;d never seen them before, which was unusual....</p><h2>Main Currents of Marxism: The Founders - The Golden Age - The Breakdown</h2><p><p><strong>Leszek Kolakowski&#x2019;s masterpiece, one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most important books&#x2015;for the first time in a one-volume paperback.</strong></p> Renowned philosopher Leszek Kolakowski was one of the first scholars to reveal both the shortcomings and the dangers posed by communist regimes.

As a consequence,&nbsp;Hegel&#x2019;s absolute idealism has become the bogeyman of philosophy, obscuring&nbsp;the fact that he is the defining philosopher of the historical transition to&nbsp;modernity, a period with which our own times share startling similarities.<br><br>Today, as global capitalism comes apart at the seams, we are entering a new&nbsp;period of transition.

But the world also left its mark on him.</p><p><em>I Had a Hammer</em> is much more than the intimate autobiography of one of the greatest names in pro sports&#x2014;it is a fascinating social history of twentieth-century America. With courage and candor, Aaron recalls his struggles and triumphs in an atmosphere of virulent racism. He relives the breathtaking moment when, in the heat of hatred and controversy, he hit his 715th home run to break Ruth's cherished record&#x2014;an accomplishment for which Aaron received more than 900,000 letters, many of them vicious and racially charged. And his story continues through the remainder of his milestone-setting, barrier-smashing career as a player and, later, Atlanta Braves executive&#x2014;offering an eye-opening and unforgettable portrait of an incomparable athlete, his sport, his epoch, and his world.</p></p><p>Fans will be eager to read all-time home-run king Aaron's autobiography, written with freelancer Wheeler, especially as he was one of the last major league players with his roots in the Negro League. At 18 the Mobile, Ala.-born athlete was signed by the Indianapolis Clowns and within months was on his way to organized white baseball. He helped to integrate the South Atlantic (Sally) League--a horrible experience--and within two years was playing for the Braves in Milwaukee, Wis., a city that loved him; after 13 years the team moved to Atlanta, where he was shown little affection. Each chapter begins with a scene-setting introduction by Wheeler, then Aaron takes over, aided by reminiscences of boyhood friends, former teammates and baseball executives. The book is as much a social document as a memoir, for Aaron is militant on race relations and views himself as a major successor to Jackie Robinson in the fight to end sports racism, which he finds widely practiced still.

It is the first-hand account of the prejudice faced by Aaron and his contemporaries who followed Jackie Robinson into the big leagues. The narrative is modest yet supremely confident ; from it emerges a picture of an incredibly talented man who fought for the opportunities he deserved. During the 23 years he played the game, Aaron became the best hitter of all time, surpassing even Ted Williams and Willie Mays.

What is it about patriarchy that seems to make it so resilient and resistant to change? Undoubtedly it endures in part because some people benefit from the unequal advantages it confers. But is that enough to explain its stubborn persistence?<br><br> In this highly original and persuasively argued book, Carol Gilligan and Naomi Snider put forward a different view: they argue that patriarchy persists because it serves a psychological function. By requiring us to sacrifice love for the sake of hierarchy, patriarchy protects us from the vulnerability of loving and becomes a defense against loss. Uncovering the powerful psychological mechanisms that underpin patriarchy, the authors show how forces beyond our awareness may be driving a politics that otherwise seems inexplicable.</p><p><b>Carol Gilligan</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Humanities and Applied Psychology at New York University and the author of&nbsp;<i>In a Different Voice</i>, one of the most influential feminist books of all time.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Naomi Snider</b>&nbsp;is a Research Fellow at New York University.<p>&#x201c;Taking on the long brewing battle between true democracy and the pervasive &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; of patriarchy, this compact book exists in a category of its own.

Carol Gilligan and Naomi Snider&#x2019;s new book, Why Does Patriarchy Persist?,&nbsp; does more than that. It is a spark. It is something like a book-length speech act, both illocutionary and perlocutionary: in speaking, the authors bring their thesis into being, and with it a host of possibilities come alive within us.

Selections include works of history, memoirs, letters, and essays, as well as fiction, poetry, and drama. Adding to the importance of the volume are several selections from rare and little-known texts that have been translated into English for the first time.</p><p>Harold Augenbraum, the executive director of the National Book Foundation, is a noted author, editor, and translator. His works include the anthologies <i>Growing Up Latino</i> and <i>Lengua Fresca</i>, which were coedited with Ilan Stavans.Anthologies of Latino literature abound, and rightly so, but most focus on contemporary authors. Augenbraum and Olmos dig deeper, tracing the roots of this vibrant literary tradition all the way back to the mid-sixteenth century. They have selected strikingly effective works of history, memoirs, letters, essays, poetry, drama, and fiction, including texts translated into English for the first time, creating a broad range of voices and perspectives. The volume begins with Alva Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's <i>Account</i>, a chronicle of a disastrous 1527 expedition in the Southwest that is emblematic of all encounters between Spanish conquistadores and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This powerful piece serves as the anthology's overture, and establishes Latino literature's key cultural and political themes. Other compelling and enlightening offerings include works by William Carlos Williams, a poet whose Puerto Rican heritage has rarely been considered integral to his poetic innovations; novelist John Rechy; Cleofas Jaramillo, a descendent of <i>hispano</i> pioneers; and a host of remarkable Latino writers prominent in decades past but overlooked in recent compilations. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Scene &amp; Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)</h2><p><b>Craft your fiction with scene-by-scene flow, logic and readability.</b><br><br>An imprisoned man receives an unexpected caller, after which "everything changed..."<br><br>And the reader is hooked.

Economic inequality is at historic highs. But inequality's impact differs by race; African Americans' net wealth is just a tenth that of white Americans, and over recent decades, white families have accumulated wealth at three times the rate of black families. In our increasingly diverse nation, sociologist Thomas M. Shapiro argues, wealth disparities must be understood in tandem with racial inequities--a dangerous combination he terms "toxic inequality." <br><br>In <i>Toxic Inequality</i>, Shapiro reveals how these forces combine to trap families in place. Following nearly two hundred families of different races and income levels over a period of twelve years, Shapiro's research vividly documents the recession's toll on parents and children, the ways families use assets to manage crises and create opportunities, and the real reasons some families build wealth while others struggle in poverty. The structure of our neighborhoods, workplaces, and tax code-much more than individual choices-push some forward and hold others back. A lack of assets, far more common in families of color, can often ruin parents' careful plans for themselves and their children.<br><br>Toxic inequality may seem inexorable, but it is not inevitable. America's growing wealth gap and its yawning racial divide have been forged by history and preserved by policy, and only bold, race-conscious reforms can move us toward a more just society.<br><b>"Everyone concerned about the toxic effects of inequality must read this book."--Robert B. Reich</b><b><br></b><b>"This is one of the most thought-provoking books I have read on economic inequality in the US."--William Julius Wilson</b></p><p><b>Thomas M. Shapiro</b> is the Pokross Professor of Law and Social Policy at the Heller School, Brandeis University, where he directs the Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The author of four books, including <i>The Hidden Cost of Being African American</i> and, with Melvin Oliver, <i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i>, he lives in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts."[In <i>Toxic Inequality</i>] Shapiro, a public-policy specialist, explores the fault lines of race in the landscape of inequality. The book draws on two sets of interviews with 137 US families of different ethnicities and levels of income over a decade, and argues that class must not eclipse race as an explanation of wealth inequality.... Shapiro argues that virtues such as thrift or dedication are not enough to overcome these disadvantages--especially when policy (that is, health-care coverage and housing regulations) makes it harder to build wealth."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Shapiro makes a persuasive and well-written case that families are not poor because they lack personal responsibility or are lazy and prefer welfare to working, but rather because of the lottery of birth. Inherited wealth, education, employment conditions, tax laws and the circumstances of one's birth distinguish those who get ahead from those who fall behind."&#x2015;<b><i><b>John K. Collins, <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A strong case that deserves a wider readership than just policy wonks."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A thorough read on inequality when considering race, wealth, and wealth gaps.... Although heavy on sociological research, Shapiro's work is easy to follow and valuable for [those] interested in expanding their knowledge on factors that affect economic mobility among marginalized groups."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this lucid and compelling book, Thomas M. Shapiro convincingly argues why we can't understand wealth and income inequality in America without also understanding racial inequality, and that any potential solution to the former must also remedy the nation's widening racial divide. He shows how wealth and race compound historic injustices through their combined effects on housing, schools and colleges, employment, and politics. Everyone concerned about the toxic effects of inequality must read this book."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Robert B. Reich, author of <i>Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this indispensable book, Thomas M.

McGhee, President, Demos</b></i></b><br><br>"Thomas M. Shapiro brilliantly analyzes the most important economic challenge of our time.

Thomas M. Shapiro's poignant stories of families coping with financial stress and insecurity, based on interviews over several years, are buttressed by his persuasive account of how economic, political, and social forces enhance the relationship between wealth disparities and racial inequities. Shapiro's penetrating analysis and bold policy prescriptions make <i>Toxic Inequality</i> a must-read."&#x2015;<b><i><b>William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University</b></i></b><br><br>"In <i>Toxic Inequality</i>, Thomas M. Shapiro shows that inequality harms everyone--that it squanders talents, misallocates resources, and suppresses initiative.

Based on 15 years of research, this is a unique book which throws a penetrating light on the secret traditions of early Christianity.

Theodosia Browning, intrepid owner of the Indigo Tea Shop in Charleston, S.C., is catering a glittering show of gems and jewels hosted by her friend Brooke Carter Crockett, owner of Heart's Desire Fine Jewelry. The elegant affair is proceeding apace when a truck smashes through the shop's front window and a gang of jewel thieves leaps out to commit a smash-and-grab robbery of gems worth millions. The theft only takes two minutes, but the brutal invasion robs Brooke of more than jewels: a shard of glass from the shattered window kills her 20-year-old niece, Kaitlin Crockett. When Brooke asks Theodosia to help find Kaitlin's killers, Theodosia comes up with a bold plan to lure the thieves with a fabulous brooch. A charming cast of characters, a cultivated and genteel setting, plenty of tea and scones, a plausible slate of suspects, and an exciting climatic chase in designer clothes and jewels all add up to another enjoyable outing with Theodosia and friends.

This is the tenth in a series of 12 books that will train students over 6 years.</p><p>In <i>Writing &amp; Rhetoric Book 10: Thesis Part 1 (Student Edition)</i>, students&nbsp;will write well-crafted persuasive thesis essays with narrative, descriptive, expository, and comparative elements. The thesis essay is perhaps the most important form of academic writing. In fact, in every major in college, successful exams and term papers depend on excellent thesis writing. Each composition requires strong critical thinking skills, an understanding of audiences and how to hook them, and a logical progression of ideas and evidence. The thesis exercise employs all of the skills students have gained in their study of the progymnasmata and adds something more: the consideration and rebuttal of counterarguments. By thinking through opposition to their main ideas, students grow in their ability to think flexibly and to defend their position. In addition, the thesis essay will help students to examine and sustain ideas, two skills much needed in today's public discourse.</p><p> In this one-semester book, students will learn to:</p><p></p><ul><li>create complex thesis statements</li><li>write thesis essays with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion</li><li>sustain arguments for 6 paragraphs</li><li>use topic sentences for organizing paragraphs and information </li><li>incorporate supportive facts and details, including quotations, paraphrases, and allusions</li><li>understand audiences better, hook their attention, and consider the purpose for reaching them</li><li>appeal to readers though credibility (ethos) and logic (logos)</li><li>build copiousness through sentence variety and rhetorical devices, including alliteration, simile, metaphor, hyperbole, epistrophe, and anaphora</li><li>improve essays using speaking as an aid to revision </li><li>revise essays for redundancies, padded writing, informal tone, dangling modifiers, and faulty predication</li><li>analyze literature excerpts for theme </li></ul>annotate texts and narrate them both orally and in summary formwork on delivery in public speaking volume, pacing, and inflection</p><p>Paul Kortepeter currently serves as curriculum director and 8th-grade teacher at The Oaks Academy, a private K 12 classical school in Indianapolis.

It contains carefully compiled government recipes that were used by Polish meat plants between 1950-1990. Those recipes were not written by restaurant cooks or college students running web sites, but by the best professionals in the meat science industry the country had. The recipes presented in this book come from those government manuals and they were never published before. These are recipes and production processes of the authentic products that were made by Polish meat plants and sold to the public. Most of those sausages are still made and sold in Poland. The unique strength of the book lies in those detailed instructions and after reading the book the readers will understand how to make all types of sausages, select the best meats and apply cures, smoke products with cold or hot smoke, and create their own recipes without adding chemicals.</p><p>Stanley Marianski is the author of eleven books which include topics on meat smoking, pickling and making alcoholic beverages. Stanley actively participates in many forums and conferences related to meat smoking; he is a regular participant of the Wedliny Domowe National Conference in Poland where purveyors of meat products get the opportunity to showcase their goods. His main objective in writing his books which always contain diagrams is to help the reader &#34;understand the sausage making process&#34; and then &#34;create his own recipes.&#34; His passion for creating unique sausage blends have been handed down from generations and he looks forward to continue sharing this passion with sons who also co-authored most of his books.</p><h2>The Complete Book of Chakra Healing: Activate the Transformative Power of Your Energy Centers</h2><p><p>Cyndi Dale's <em>New Chakra Healing</em> established a new standard for healers, intuitives, and energy workers worldwide.

In this brilliant book about metaphor James Geary is no less astonishing, as he deciphers the subtle implications embedded in advertising slogans, familiar slang and government double-talk.... You'll scarf down every page of <em>I Is an Other </em>and then ask for more.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Dirda, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic and author of <em>Book by Book </em>and <em>Classics for Pleasure<br><br></em>For lovers of language and fans of <em>Blink </em>and <em>Freakonomics</em>, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author James Geary offers this fascinating look at metaphors and their influence in every aspect of our lives, from art to medicine, psychology to the stock market.<br></p><p><p>From President Obama&#x2019;s political rhetoric to the bursting of the housing bubble, from conversations to commercials, James Geary shows that every aspect of our day-to-day experience is molded by metaphor. Geary takes readers from Aristotle&#x2019;s investigation of metaphor right up to the latest neuroscientific insights into how metaphor works in the brain. Witty, persuasive, and original, <em>I Is an Other</em> explores metaphor&#x2019;s effects on financial decision making, effective advertising, leadership, learning, and more. Romeo&#x2019;s exclamation &#x201c;It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!&#x201d; may be one of the most well-known metaphors in literature, but metaphor is more than a device of love-struck poets.

The book will be invaluable for any student of theology or intellectual history, and for anyone who wants to see the intellectual cogency of the Christian faith at its best. The intellectual tradition of the Church emerges clearly from this book as one of the glories of the Christian inheritance. <br>Andrew Davison argues that Christian thinkers will be more faithful to Christian teaching, not less, if they pay attention to philosophy. Our thinking is always philosophical, since we cannot think without categories or assumption. Our philosophy may as well, therefore, be good philosophy. By bringing our philosophy out into the open we can bring them under theological judgement.<br>Clear and articulate, this book provides the philosophical background to Christian theology down the ages, and examines the intellectual climate of our own times.<br></p><p>Andrew Davison is Tutor in Christian Doctrine at Westcott House, Cambridge, UK.&nbsp;From April 2014, he will be the Starbridge Lecturer in Theology and Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge.Theology is far too wonderful a calling and a gift for its human practitioners to risk the absence of any potential allies. Among these, the magnificently clarifying agility and imaginative equipment of the philosophical traditions have been massively helpful to theologians who know how to command their aid without becoming becalmed within their own limitations. Andrew Davison�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s book will be the invaluable companion for all who seek to grow theologically. He adroitly surveys the most crucial interactions of theology and philosophy over the centuries, but�&#x20ac;"more importantly�&#x20ac;"he brings to life the most exciting and informing encounters. -- Mark A. McIntosh�<br><br>Theology today is eclectic: it is now possible to draw constructively on so many systems of thought that once were relegated to the history of ideas. Andrew Davison�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s book lays out the wealth of these systems with the exactitude of a scientist and the attentiveness of a teacher. Particularly unique and helpful is his charting of philosophical ideas in their actual and potential theological lives. For the theologian in need of a careful, thorough, charitable, and critical introduction to the history of philosophy, it is difficult to imagine a more fitting work. -- Anthony D.

We spend most of our lives in houses surrounded by manicured lawns, living in towns or cities where recrecational activies are based on human-centered sports. Nature is something we go to a park to see, or we watch a show about it on TV. </p><p>Those of us in the field of environmental education try to preach a different message, telling people that "all life is interconnected" and that "we really are part of nature". But in the next breath we tell them to stay on the trails and to practice "no-trace" camping. We tell them to look at nature and photograph it, but not to touch it. We tell them our modern way of life is destroying nature, and that we need to stop mucking up the planet. In other words, we tell them we are part of nature--the bad part! </p><p>Here at HOPS Press, LLC we advocate a positive interactive relationship with the natural world. We want people to get involved in nature, to be a part of the process on many levels: </p><p>Through Participating in Nature: Thomas J. Elpel's Field Guide to Primitive Living Skills and the Art of Nothing Wilderness Survival Video Series, you can experience an intimate connection with nature as you rediscover the skills our ancestors used to survive for tens of thousands of years. Instead of merely camping in the wilderness or passing through it, you will become part of the process as you learn about nature by using it to meet your needs for shelter, fire, water and food. Learn to set aside the trappings of modern culture and step directly into nature with little or nothing, to experience nature on its own terms. </p><p>With Tom's book Botany in a Day: The Patterns Method of Plant Identification, you can connect with the wonderful diversity of plants and flowers all around you in a way that you may have never imagined. Instead of seeing the green world as little more than pretty wallpaper, you will learn to know the individual plants, wildflowers and weeds as if they have been your life-long friends. Our book Shanleya's Quest: A Botany Adventure for Kids Ages 9-99 utilizes the same patterns method of identifying plants as Botany in a Day, but in a metaphorical story form where children of all ages can join young Shanleya on her journey to learn the plant traditions of her people. </p><p>In Living Homes: Integrated Design &amp; Construction you will learn how to make your home part of nature, as well as how to make nature part of your home. Learn the secrets to building low-cost, high-efficiency homes with stone masonry, log-building and strawbale construction methods. With this book and Tom's Slipform Stone Masonry DVD/VHS Video you will be able to build your quality, earth-friendly Dream home on a budget, even while the "experts" say it isn't cost effective. </p><p>Finally, in Direct Pointing to Real Wealth: Thomas J. Elpel's Field Guide to Money, you will learn to see the economy as an ecosystem where money is a token that represents calories of energy. Learn the basic rules of this economic ecosystem and you will be empowered to use your resources to more effectively achieve your desired quality of life, while making the world a better place to be. You will be able help convert an economy that harms planetary biodiversity into an economy that helps restore it.</p>Thomas J. Elpel had the rare opportunity as a child to spend hundreds of hours with his grandmother Josie Jewett. Together they explored the hills and meadows near Virginia City, Montana, collecting herbs, looking for arrowheads and watching wildlife. Grandma Josie helped Tom to learn about native plants and their uses, igniting a passion for nature that has inspired him ever since. <p><i>Shanleya's Quest</i> reflects a similar passing of the torch across generations, as Shanleya is mentored in the plant traditions of her people by her Grandfather.</p></p><h2>The Deceivers (A John Wells Novel)</h2><p><b><b>THE </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER</b><br><br><b><i>Interfering with the presidential election was just the first step.</i></b><br><br><b>The Russians don't just want to influence American elections--they want it all.

The former CIA director, now president, Vinnie Duto has plenty of people working in Texas. He wants Wells to go to Colombia.

He graduated from Yale University in 1994 with degrees in history and economics, and lives in New York City.<p><b>1</b></p><p>Columbus, Georgia</p><p>The Waffle House lay on Victory Drive, close by Commando Military Supply and the gates to Fort Benning, the two-hundred-eighty-square-mile base where the Army made soldiers into Rangers. John Wells remembered the restaurant from his own training, more than two decades before.</p><p>Back then, he&#x2019;d still basically been a Montana boy. He&#x2019;d come to Dartmouth for college, been shocked by the superior attitude so many East Coast kids put on. But Georgia had held its own surprises. At least Montana and New Hampshire both had mountains, even if the Bitterroots were bigger. Down here, the land was slap flat and swamp-cut.</p><p>Anyway, as far as Wells could tell, the Waffle House hadn&#x2019;t changed. Not the waitresses, not the plastic booths, maybe not the fryer grease.</p><p>The Ranger instructors eating one booth over looked the same, too. Square-jawed and narrow-eyed. Mostly white. Maybe a few more tattoos. They shoveled scrambled eggs in their mouths like they were machines for the ingestion of food. Cut, chew, swallow. Cut, chew, swallow. Wash it all down with the black liquid that Waffle House called coffee. They were almost too tired to speak, Wells saw.</p><p>Though not as tired as the soldiers they were training. Nothing in peacetime replicated combat, but Ranger School tried.&nbsp;<i>Rangers lead the way,&nbsp;</i>the unit&#x2019;s motto went. The training program was meant to weed out any soldier who couldn&#x2019;t. It was famously tough, especially at the beginning. Candidates were deprived of sleep and food while facing timed marches and the Darby Queen, a barbed-wire-studded obstacle course. Soldiers qualified through airborne training and a four-week starter course before they even had a chance at Fort Benning. Still, about sixty percent failed. Many who did pass had to repeat at least one part of the three-phase program.</p><p>Not Wells. He&#x2019;d gone through in the minimum sixty-two days. He was made for soldiering. Not just because he was strong and lean and quick. Because he knew intuitively how to survive, to narrow his focus. Not to think ahead, not to promise himself that he&#x2019;d get through this day or week but simply to&nbsp;<i>get through</i>.</p><p>A most un-Buddhist form of mindfulness.</p><p>So Wells went from Dartmouth to the Rangers, the Rangers to the Central Intelligence Agency, Langley to the Hindu Kush, the Kush back to the United States. Only the start of his travels. Two decades of spying and fighting, killing and not quite dying. He&#x2019;d resigned from the agency but discovered he needed it as much as it seemed to need him. He&#x2019;d become a Muslim, too, finding comfort, of sorts, in a faith not his own. And why not? All faiths were foreign in the end, walks through dark woods.</p><p>Had he changed? He supposed he must have. From the start, he&#x2019;d been unafraid to kill, to take what he could never give back. Yet his dreams troubled him more than they once had&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Need anything?&#x201d; The waitress&#x2019;s smoke-roughened voice. Meaning:&nbsp;<i>You&#x2019;ve been sitting in this booth a while, time to order more or move on.&nbsp;</i>Hungry soldiers waited by the door. Wells hadn&#x2019;t woolgathered this way twenty years ago, that he knew.</p><p>&#x201c;Scrambled eggs with cheese. Triple order hash browns.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Triple? Coming up.&#x201d; She offered him a broke-down smile and turned away. The United States had two thousand Waffle Houses, not one in the Northeast or on the West Coast. Places for working people who needed quick food cheap and cheap food quick. The eggs were iffy, but the hash browns were delicious, as long as Wells didn&#x2019;t think about what they were doing to his arteries.</p><p>He was waiting for his son. Evan. Though Evan didn&#x2019;t think of Wells as his father. Another man had raised the boy while Wells snaked the world&#x2019;s drains. Yet Evan, a grown man now, had decided to become a Ranger. Wells wasn&#x2019;t quite sure why. He was proud, but he feared Evan didn&#x2019;t understand the choice he&#x2019;d made.</p><p>Evan had been one of the first-week Fort Benning failures. Not his fault. He&#x2019;d blown his Achilles tendon eleven miles into the twelve-mile road march, the week&#x2019;s concluding exercise. Twelve miles didn&#x2019;t sound like much, except the candidates carried close to a hundred pounds of gear. Because Evan had failed for medical reasons, he could rehab here while he waited for another chance. If he wanted.</p><p>He&#x2019;d called Wells the day before, two days after the injury, asked him to come to Georgia.</p><p>&#x201c;Pep talk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>All his life, Evan had carried a golden ticket. Now defeat hung in his voice. Wells caught a dawn flight from Boston to Atlanta, rented a car for the easy hundred-mile drive to Columbus, on the Georgia&#x2013;Alabama border. Eleven a.m., and here he was.</p><p>He watched Evan park his gray Toyota Highlander&#x2014;the SUV too new, too nice, for a young soldier, a vehicle that would earn Evan scorn rather than respect. The door swung open, and Evan hobbled out, a heavy white boot on his ankle. Like Wells, he was tall, with brown hair and cool-brown eyes. Though Evan was slimmer than Wells, more lithe. He was a superb basketball player, just a half step slow for the NBA. He&#x2019;d started at shooting guard for San Diego State&#x2019;s nationally ranked team.</p><p>Wells met him at the door, gave him a hug that would have been awkward even if Evan hadn&#x2019;t been wearing the boot.</p><p>&#x201c;John.&#x201d; Evan rarely called him Dad. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t take me somewhere classy like Denny&#x2019;s?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re missing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she said.&#x201d; Evan banged his foot into the edge of a booth and grimaced.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe focus on walking.&#x201d;</p><p>The hash browns beat them to the booth.</p><p>&#x201c;If this is what getting old is like, I&#x2019;ll skip it,&#x201d; Evan said.</p><p>&#x201c;You may reconsider.&#x201d; Wells helped him sit.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Anne? You&#x2019;re living together, right?&#x201d;</p><p>So they were, in the farmhouse in New Hampshire that had become as much of a home as Wells expected to find. Anne was Wells&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>girlfriend</i>,&nbsp;<i>partner</i>&#x2014;whatever term of art the kids used these days. Not&nbsp;<i>wife</i>, though. Wells had proposed and been refused twice now. She&#x2019;d told him she didn&#x2019;t want a ring, she wanted his heart, and she&#x2019;d know when his heart was ready. Left unsaid were the words&nbsp;<i>And it&#x2019;s never gonna be.&nbsp;</i>Though his unready heart hadn&#x2019;t stopped them from having a daughter together. And now&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Anne&#x2019;s pregnant.&#x201d; The first time he&#x2019;d spoken the words aloud. He felt a swell of masculine pride despite the foolishness of having another child out of wedlock. But why not? He and Anne were good parents. And, truth, if anything happened to him, he&#x2019;d put enough money aside to make sure the kids would have their educations paid for. Beyond that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anne was smart and steady and he supposed he trusted she would find someone else. Evan had done all right without him.</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously? Another half sister?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sonogram says&nbsp;<i>brother</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know there are these things called condoms, John&#x2014;&#x201d; Evan grinned in genuine pleasure. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you now.&#x201d; What he wasn&#x2019;t telling, and wouldn&#x2019;t: Anne had miscarried three times since Emmie, their daughter. Wells hadn&#x2019;t wanted to say anything until they were sure. But she was sixteen weeks along, and the sonogram and every genetic test ever invented said the baby was healthy.</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Glad one of us has good news, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>Evan grimaced, reliving the injury. &#x201c;I felt the tendon getting super-tight, which used to happen at the end of games sometimes. Then&nbsp;<i>Snap!&nbsp;</i>I heard it even before I felt it. Then I was on my ass, like someone took a blowtorch to my leg. The other guys tried to help me. I knew I wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere. I told them,&nbsp;<i>Don&#x2019;t stop, don&#x2019;t mess up your march.&nbsp;</i>Just waited for the NCOs. Man, it hurt. But that&#x2019;s not the part that&#x2019;s messed up.&#x201d;</p><p>Wells waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Felt like I&#x2019;d gotten a get-out-of-jail-free card.&#x201d; Evan mumbled now as if the words burned his mouth. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand these rules. Sergeants yelling at me.&nbsp;<i>Surfer boy!Pretty boy!</i>&nbsp;<i>College boy!</i>&nbsp;And the other soldiers, they&#x2019;re barely eighteen, they all think it&#x2019;s a big gym class. Jackasses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I recall, you engaged in a bit of jackassery in San Diego.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to sound like a snob, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you are, and you didn&#x2019;t even know until you got here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We barely get any sleep, anyway, and they won&#x2019;t shut up all night. Talking about how much ass they&#x2019;ll get when they tell girls they&#x2019;re -Rangers. And when are they gonna blow claymores and try the 249.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me you don&#x2019;t want to shoot a machine gun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Worst part is, all this crap about how they can&#x2019;t wait to get deployed so they can start killing Arabs.&nbsp;<i>Make them pay for what happened last week.</i>&#x201d; The funerals were still happening in Dallas, the flags still at half-staff. &#x201c;<i>Nuke Syria.</i>&nbsp;They don&#x2019;t even know the difference between Sunni and Shia. Remember a few years ago, in Missoula&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>At the time, Evan had accused Wells of being a psychopath, a contract killer whose sole client was the United States government.</p><p>&#x201c;And you grew up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw it was more complicated. But this takes me back to that, because that&#x2019;s all these guys want. Was it like that when you were here?&#x201d;</p><p>Wells nodded. Though, back then, the imagined targets had been the Russians and the Chinese.&nbsp;<i>Chink-chonk-cho, I shoot you, ah-so.&nbsp;</i>Fortunately, that guy had washed out. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re nervous. Trying to hide it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t sound nervous. They sound&nbsp;<i>amped</i>. If that&#x2019;s what it takes to kill people, I don&#x2019;t have it.&#x201d;</p><p>The real reason Evan had called him. Wells let him eat for a minute and then leaned close.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you have it. Or any of those other guys. Nobody knows. All those obstacle courses and live-fire exercises, they just tell you who&nbsp;<i>can&#x2019;t</i>&nbsp;do it. You flinch here, then you&#x2019;re probably gonna be no good in the real thing. But it doesn&#x2019;t work the other way. Guys can roll through the Darby Queen because in the back of their minds they know it&#x2019;s training. Combat&#x2019;s different. It&#x2019;s only when you&#x2019;re up against people who want to kill you that you can be sure how you&#x2019;ll react.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kinda late by then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what&#x2019;s more like combat than anything else? Football.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of the hitting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because, in the moment, it&#x2019;s you or them. And basketball&#x2019;s not the same in terms of the physicality, but it takes that focus. If I had to bet, I&#x2019;d bet on you.&#x201d;</p><p>They were quiet for a minute.</p><p>&#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re right. What am I looking at? Months of rehab. Then years of taking orders from guys who barely got through high school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On the bright side, by the time you&#x2019;re done you&#x2019;ll be a killing machine who can&#x2019;t live normal civilian life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You make it sound so appealing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Know where we could have used a couple Rangers last week.&#x201d;</p><p>Words that snapped up Evan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told you what to do this whole time. But I&#x2019;m telling you now. Don&#x2019;t quit. Not this way. It&#x2019;ll feel good for a month and then it&#x2019;ll haunt you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the knuckleheads?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your mouth shut. If you can soldier, they&#x2019;ll respect you soon enough. Maybe dump that forty-thousand-dollar station wagon outside, too, so it&#x2019;s not so obvious you don&#x2019;t fit in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s gonna kill you. She told me not to call.&#x201d; Heather, Wells&#x2019;s ex-wife and Evan&#x2019;s mom, hadn&#x2019;t wanted Evan to sign up. To say the least. Evan had told Wells that she&#x2019;d threatened to cut off his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Least you won&#x2019;t be living in the basement like all the other millennials.&#x201d; The waitress was coming their way. Wells fished for his wallet. &#x201c;Come on. We stay much longer she&#x2019;ll make us sign a lease.&#x201d;</p><p>Wells called Anne as the Highlander swung out.</p><p>&#x201c;Babe.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d started calling him that recently. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Evan? What I thought?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I told him not to.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence. Anne told Wells not to argue if Evan wanted to quit.&nbsp;<i>You need to let him find his own way.</i></p><p>&#x201c;He wanted me to change his mind, Anne. Why he asked me to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hope so,&#x201d; she said, as his phone beeped with an incoming number, a 202 area code. Wells wanted to be surprised, but some part of him had expected this call since the first bulletins from Dallas.</p><p>&#x201c;Call you back.&#x201d; He clicked through.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Wells?&#x201d; A man. &#x201c;President Duto would like you to come in. Are you in New Hampshire?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fort Benning.&#x201d;</p><p>A pause. Wells realized the man at the White House had never heard of Fort Benning. And civilians wondered why soldiers didn&#x2019;t respect them. &#x201c;Military base in Georgia. Has an airport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you back.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice was gone.&nbsp;<i>President Duto would like you to come in.&nbsp;</i>Not a question. Wells called Anne.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to stop in D.C.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m pregnant, John. Or have you forgotten?&nbsp;</i>Words she&#x2019;d never say. &#x201c;Tell the gang I said hi.&#x201d;</p><p>Five hours later, Wells walked into the Oval Office to find Vinny Duto flipping through a briefing book in a black binder. Even when Wells had first met Duto a decade before, the bags under his eyes had been prominent. Now they sagged into his cheeks. He looked like he hadn&#x2019;t slept in days. He probably hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;John. Thanks for coming.&#x201d;</p><p>Duto had been been justifiably proud of his record, Wells knew. Proud the country hadn&#x2019;t suffered a major terrorist attack while he was director of the CIA or president. Until now. Four killers, three hundred dead, the Islamic State claiming credit.</p><p>Duto flipped through the binder. Wells glimpsed photos, pools of blood. He waited for Duto to explain what the agency and FBI knew and what they didn&#x2019;t, what the next moves would be.</p><p>&#x201c;Want a drink?&#x201d; Duto said abruptly.</p><p>Wells didn&#x2019;t. And it was barely 5 p.m. And Islam forbade alcohol, anyway. But he couldn&#x2019;t make the President of the United States drink alone in the Oval Office. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Duto closed the binder and gave a low, grateful sigh, the sound of a dog kenneling itself under a porch on a hot day. He&#x2019;d installed a chrome-and-leather bar cart by the Oval Office&#x2019;s second door, the one that led to the bathroom and points beyond. He plucked a bottle, thick glass and a cork stopper, labeled with a hand-drawn cowboy sitting on a white horse.&nbsp;<i>High West, yippee ki-yay.&nbsp;</i>He poured himself half a highball glass. For Wells, barely a finger.</p><p>&#x201c;To those pricks. May they rot in Hell.&#x201d; Duto raised his glass, took a pull. Wells gave himself a mouthful. The stuff wasn&#x2019;t bad, a little sweetness to hide the fire underneath. Duto&#x2019;s face loosened as the liquor hit him.</p></p><h2>The Pot Book: A Complete Guide to Cannabis</h2><p>Leading experts on the science, history, politics, medicine, and potential of America&#x2019;s most popular recreational drug <br> <br>� With contributions by Andrew Weil, Michael Pollan, Lester Grinspoon, Allen St. Pierre (NORML), Tommy Chong, and others <br> <br>� Covers marijuana&#x2019;s physiological and psychological effects, its medicinal uses, the complex politics of cannabis law, pot and parenting, its role in creativity, business, and spirituality, and much more <br> <br>Exploring the role of cannabis in medicine, politics, history, and society, <i>The Pot Book</i> offers a compendium of the most up-to-date information and scientific research on marijuana from leading experts, including Lester Grinspoon, M.D., Rick Doblin, Ph.D., Allen St. Pierre (NORML), and Raphael Mechoulam.

In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas "32" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county&#x2014;and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town.<p></p> More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades.<p></p><p></p> <strong> A Q&amp;A with Author Tom Franklin </strong><br><strong> </strong> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Tell us a bit about your latest book <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i>. How did you come up with the title? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> Title's a pneumonic device used to teach children (mostly southern children) how to spell Mississippi. M, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, humpback, humback, I.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> is a bit of a departure from your previous two novels&#x2014;<i>Smonk</i> and <i>Hell at the Breech</i>&#x2014;in that it is set in contemporary times and the story line is a bit less dark. What inspired the premise for this novel and the departure from a more historical setting? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I'd been wanting to write about a small town police officer, and I'd long had the image of a loner mechanic in my mind. When I put the two together, the story began to form. I used a lot of autobiographical stuff for Larry, the mechanic. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> A review in <i>USA Today</i> (for <i>Hell at the Breech</i>) stated that, &#x201c;he also makes his characters rise up from the pages as if they were there with you.&#x201d; ...and this is certainly true in your latest novel. How do you approach the task of developing your characters and bringing them to life? Are the characters in <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> based on anyone in particular?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> They're both a combination of different facets of different people, a conglomeration of fact and fiction. I usually try to just let them begin to do what they want to do, just put them in a situation and see what they do. When they begin to surprise me, do things I hadn't anticipated, that's when it's working.<br><br> But the character of Silas "32" Jones is very loosely based on the sole police officer of the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, where I grew up. This guy was actually the law in a nearby mill town, and my hamlet of Dickinson fell in his tiny jurisdiction. I've always loved the idea of small town cops, especially one who might be a kind of underdog to the police forces of nearby larger towns.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> your two main characters are anything but stereotypical&#x2014;the young black boy goes off to college to play baseball and comes back to be the town constable and the young white boy is the accused murderer and the town outcast. What, if anything, prompted you to portray these characters this way? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> No real person is a stereotype, and I try to make my characters as real as I can. We're all a mess of contradictions and secrets, strangenesses and desires, and nobody's all good or all bad. We're all somewhere in the spectrum between absolute good and absolute evil. So I just try to find a character who's fairly normal, and put him or her in a fix and see how he or she negotiates it to see, as Kurt Vonnegut says, what he or she is made of. In this case, the story as I came to understand it called for Larry to stay home and Silas to leave. If it had been the other way around, I'd still work to make the characters unstereotypical. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Without giving away too much of the story, what is one thing (emotion, thought) that readers can expect to walk away with after reading this book? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> It's a sad book, but it's full of hope. Hope is what I want a reader to leave with.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Historically the South has not always had a positive image in other parts of the country. How has your experience growing up and living in the rural South shaped your talent as a writer? And have you ever felt the need to justify or redeem the South&#x2019;s past in any of your works?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I think growing up in the south made me the person I am, and the writer I am comes from that. So, yes, the south's made me the writer I am. It taught me to listen to the cadences and rhythms of speech, and to notice the landscape. It also has this defeated feel, a lingering of old sin, that makes it sweet in a rotting kind of way. Much of it is poor, much is rural, and that's an interesting combination, a deep well for stories.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you always know that you wanted to be a writer? Who are some writers, past and present, that you admire or have inspired you? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I always knew I wanted to tell stories, one way or another. If I'd had a video camera in the mid 1970s I'm sure I'd be a filmmaker now. But I just had a portable typewriter, and so the stories I could tell were ones on paper.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are one of the most celebrated writers in the field, and have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, William Faulkner, and Elmore Leonard. What do you believe is the one thing that sets you apart from other contemporary writers in your genre? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> What sets me apart? I honestly don't know that I&#x2019;m more "apart" from other writers of my generation. Landscape plays a large role in what I write, but that's true of many other writers. My stuff is set in the south, but that's true of others as well. I don't know, honestly.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> As a professor of English, what is one piece of advice that you would share with aspiring writers?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> Read, starting with the classics. Read all the time. If you don't read, you won't ever be a writer. Also, write. This seems obvious, but it's amazing how many "writers" don't write very much.</p><p></p><p>Tom Franklin is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</em>, which won the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize and the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award.

But, this is not fiction. <br> In early 2005, Israel's most venerated Orthodox Rabbi, Yitzhak Kaduri, claimed he had met the true, soon-coming Messiah. He also made a public announcement that he had written Messiah's name in a note. He said he would turn that note over to his ministry officials to be kept secret and locked away until one year after his death. Then, after that time, the note was to be posted on his website at kaduri.net. <br> Just a few months later, Kaduri was dead. Little did the world know what revelation awaited them. <br> Finally, the note was posted. JESUS is Messiah. That's when the global spiritual and political firestorm erupted. Several of the key players in this story are immersed in vicious abandon, attempting to bring the stunning revelation to a grinding halt. And they have already proven that they will stop at almost nothing. <br> Critically acclaimed Amazon Top 60 bestselling author Carl Gallups has now teamed up with Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, director of Messiah of Israel Ministries (Tel Aviv, Israel), and together they have dared to bring before the world the long-hidden and mysterious details of this "story that won't die." <br> You will be shocked by the gravity of the new information and the intrigue that this profusely updated story brings to your fingertips. Prepare yourself - there are treasures of amazing biblical treats in this book that, at times, will simply take your breath away. This is a gripping page turner that will be practically impossible to walk away from.&nbsp; In THE RABBI, THE SECRET MESSAGE, AND THE IDENTITY OF MESSIAH You Will Discover: <br> -The global media cover up of the ages. <br> -The death threats, ritualistic curses, and purposed obfuscation perpetrated by very powerful groups and personalities. <br> -Never-before-told secrets, eyewitness testimonies, and supernatural "back stories" to this epic account. <br> -The connectivity of this event to current geopolitical affairs, prophetic revelations, and to your daily life. <br> -The number of shocking biblical mysteries that are, in these uniquely prescient days, finally being unveiled right onto your lap. <br> -The purposed attempts to change biblical and Israeli history, important word-meanings, and long-hidden truths about the real name of God. <br> -The direct connections that the authors have with Rabbi Kaduri, his ministry organization, and several important figures within the Israeli government. Connections that lend significant authority to this story.</p><p><b>Carl Gallups says</b><b>:</b> In 2013 I had the distinct priviledge of publishing the world's first and only book about this story. That book,&nbsp;<i>The Rabbi Who Found Messiah</i>&nbsp;became an international bestseller and was eventually published in five different languages, and was also the subject of a documentary movie. The book and movie were subsequently featured in major media sources around the globe.&nbsp;<br><br>Little did I know that the first book was only a tiny beginning of this continually unfolding and stunning story. What has happened since then - as reported in this brand new book - is simply unbelievable. I could have never imagined that getting wrapped up in the reporting of this event would so deeply change my life. Yet it has, and in ways that are still emerging to this day.&nbsp;<br><br>I am convinced that what you are getting ready to read will dramatically impact your life as well.

Before becoming the ninth president of the United States in 1841, Harrison was instrumental in shaping the early years of westward expansion. Robert M. Owens now explores that era through the lens of Harrison&#x2019;s career, providing a new synthesis of his role in the political development of Indiana Territory and in shaping Indian policy in the Old Northwest.</p><p>Owens traces Harrison&#x2019;s political career as secretary of the Northwest Territory, territorial delegate to Congress, and governor of Indiana Territory, as well as his military leadership and involvement with Indian relations. Thomas Jefferson, who was president during the first decade of the nineteenth century, found in Harrison the ideal agent to carry out his administration&#x2019;s ruthless campaign to extinguish Indian land titles.</p><p>More than a study of the man, <i>Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s Hammer</i> is a cultural biography of his fellow settlers, telling how this first generation of post-Revolutionary Americans realized their vision of progress and expansionism. It surveys the military, political, and social world of the early Ohio Valley and shows that Harrison&#x2019;s attitudes and behavior reflected his Virginia background and its eighteenth-century notions as much as his frontier milieu.</p><p>To this day, we live with the echoes of Harrison&#x2019;s proclamations, the boundaries set by his treaties, and the ramifications of his actions. <i>Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s Hammer</i> offers a much needed reappraisal of Harrison&#x2019;s impact on the nation&#x2019;s development and key lessons for understanding American sentiments in the early republic.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert M.

In luminous prose, Chicago native Thomas Dyja re-creates the story of the city in its postwar prime and explains its profound impact on modern America&#x2014;from Chess Records to <i>Playboy</i>, McDonald&#x2019;s to the University of Chicago. Populated with an incredible cast of characters, including Mahalia Jackson, Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x2019; Wolf, Chuck Berry, Sun Ra, Simone de Beauvoir, Nelson Algren, Gwendolyn Brooks, Studs Turkel, and Mayor Richard J. Daley, <i>The Third Coast</i> recalls the prominence of the Windy City in all its grandeur.</p><p><b>Thomas Dyja</b> is the author of three novels and two works of nonfiction. A native of Chicago&#x2019;s Northwest Side, he was once called &#x201c;a real Chicago boy&#x201d; by Studs Turkel. He now lives in New York City.<p>Under the light of a single bulb, the old drunk slipped into a coma. Louis Sullivan, the greatest architect in a city of great architecture, lay dying of kidney disease at the Warner Hotel on 33rd and Cottage Grove, five years after the White Sox had met there to fix the 1919 World Series. His last designs had been a series of extravagant little banks in midwestern hamlets, jewel boxes cascading with his glorious ornament, but they&#x2019;d paid nothing, so old friends like his former prot�g� Frank Lloyd Wright had chipped in for this dingy room. As the bulb swung and his breathing shallowed, Chicagoans went on shopping in his department stores, cooking dinner in his homes, shuffling papers in his offices, dozing off in his theaters, and praying in the churches he&#x2019;d created. Few had any clue how Sullivan had given form to the functions of their lives.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><p>He&#x2019;d come to Chicago in 1873, chased west by the year&#x2019;s financial panic to a city whose purpose was to be in the middle. Before Marquette and Joliet came through in the late 1600s, centuries of Potawatomi Indians had portaged here between Lake Michigan and the Des Plaines River, paddling on to the Mississippi. French fur traders set up shop in the 1700s, and as the railroads pushed west in the next century, the frontier outpost named Fort Dearborn grew into Chicago, hub of the expanding nation. From every direction, people, resources, and products moved through its muddy plains, soon the site of the world&#x2019;s biggest, wildest boomtown, and when the fire of 1871 scoured most of the city away, America willed it back into existence, this time even bigger and wilder. Between 1870 and 1890, the city&#x2019;s population grew from just under 300,000 to more than a million souls densely packed and separate, every person there to do, to make, to somehow get theirs. Grain and livestock mattered as much as pig iron; labor confronted capital; new sciences were explored amid back- alley violence. &#x201c;Having seen it, I urgently desire never to see it again,&#x201d; said an uncharacteristically prim Rudyard Kipling after an 1890 visit. &#x201c;It is inhabited by savages.&#x201d; Historian William Cronon has called it &#x201c;the grandest, most spectacular country fair the world has ever seen.&#x201d; You could probably find fifty just like it now in China, but Chicago was the first of its kind, and Louis Sullivan had loved it at first sight. &#x201c;Here . . . was power,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;naked power, naked as the prairies, greater than the mountains.&#x201d;</p><br>&nbsp;<br><p>After a short stint at the �cole des Beaux- Arts in Paris, Sullivan teamed up with Dankmar Adler to design scores of buildings that expressed the extremes of the city that gave America its meat, steel, and the Wizard of Oz. Together Sullivan and Adler refined the idea of what a skyscraper should be. They pushed the limits of technology in buildings such as the Auditorium and the Schiller Theater, while Sullivan developed his distinctive ornamentation, an intricate, organic system that wound around the straight lines of modern industry, exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a grain of wheat the way Bach explored music. Sullivan&#x2019;s florid yet rational ornament mediated between Chicagoans and their buildings. It captured the creative tension between rural and urban, past and present, the individual man and the democratic nation that fueled the city. Sullivan gave form to the idea of Chicago as a crossroads, where all of America&#x2019;s impulses met to converse and trade, battle and build, each structure a message about how technology and man could thrive together. The Columbian Exposition of 1893 ended all that, though. Grand as Daniel Burnham&#x2019;s fair was, it pushed the first generation of Chicago skyscraper builders out of fashion, and the city&#x2019;s progress stumbled. Adler and Sullivan split, and as Sullivan took to the bottle, he warned&#x2014; or cursed&#x2014; that it would be fifty years before American architecture recovered. He was off by only five or so.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><p>When Sullivan died that night in 1924, he died forgotten. Chicago was no longer his city, as much as it ever had been. In the 1920s virtually everyone went on the take&#x2014; not just Al Capone but union bosses and corporate heads, aldermen and corner cops; even a few priests were mobsters under the Roman collar. Five years later the stock market crash would drag the city to the brink of collapse. </p><br>&nbsp;<br><p>Out of those ashes, Chicago did rise again. It was a slow, often painful progress infused with creativity and greed, overshadowed by the two glamorous cities on the other coasts, but central in all ways to the massmarket America we know today. Beginning in the late 1930s and rolling on through the 1950s, Chicagoans produced much of what the world now calls &#x201c;American&#x201d;: the liberated, leering sexuality of <i>Playboy</i>; glass and steel modern architecture; rock and roll and the urban blues; McDonald&#x2019;s and the spread of the fast- food nation; the improvisational sketch comedy that&#x2019;s trained everyone from Joan Rivers and John Belushi to Steve Carell and Tina Fey; <i>Ebony</i> magazine and Emmett Till, whose murder catalyzed the civil rights movement; geodesic domes; avant-garde jazz and gospel music; the Nation of Islam; modern photography; the atom bomb and the Great Books; <i>Kukla, Fran and Ollie</i>; and the last great political machine.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><p><i>The Third Coast</i> is the history of Chicago&#x2019;s greatest&#x2014; and final&#x2014; period as the nation&#x2019;s primary meeting place, market, workshop, and lab, but it is also the story of how America&#x2019;s uniform culture came to be. As New York positioned itself on the global stage and Hollywood polished the nation&#x2019;s fantasies, the most profound aspects of American modernity grew up out of the flat, prairie land next to Lake Michigan. The real struggle for America&#x2019;s future&#x2014; whether it would be directed by its people or its institutions&#x2014; took place in postwar Chicago.</p></p><h2>Anthology of Art Songs by Black American Composers: Voice and Piano</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

She is the author of The Cold-and-Hunger Dance and won the North American Indian Prose Award for Claiming Breath (Nebraska 1992).Poet, dramatist, short-story writer and essayist Glancy (winner of an American Book Award for Claiming Breath) turns her talents to the novel, recreating in this bone-true tale the sorrow, struggle and betrayal suffered by the Cherokee along the Trail of Tears. In the winter of 1838-39, 13,000 Cherokee were forced to walk the Trail of Tears from North Carolina toward the "new territory" of present-day Oklahoma. Following the Native American belief that many voices are needed to tell a story, Glancy employs a multitude of narrators. There are the voices of Cherokee of all ages and clans, of white soldiers and preachers, and snatches from actual historical records. The central narrator, Maritole, emerges to tell her personal story of "pushing the bear," a dark heavy burden of anger, impending madness, physical distress and, above all, doubt in herself and her heritage as she perseveres in the grueling walk. Maritole's shaky relationship with her husband, and the deaths of her baby and parents, push her into a relationship with a white soldier, Sergeant Williams. Ultimately, however, he can't fathom the Cherokees' mystic, symbiotic relationships with the land and with each other. At times, the novel proceeds as slowly as the march itself, but it rewards the reader with a visceral, honest presentation of the Cherokee conception of story as the indestructible chain linking people, earth and ancestry?a link that becomes, if not unmitigated salvation, then certainly a salve to the spirit. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>First novelist Glancy (Claiming Breath, LJ 3/92) prefaces her stunning narrative with a stark statement of fact: "From November 1838 to March 1839 some 11,000 to 13,000 Cherokee walked 900 miles in bitter cold from the southeast to Indian Territory. One fourth died or disappeared along the way." Drawing on these statistics and other surviving documentation, the author imaginatively re-creates a nearly unimaginable experience: the forced removal of the Cherokee peoples from their homes in four Southern states. The story is told in many voices, principally those of the uprooted-Native men and women, conjurers, Christians, politicians, leaders, and rebels?but also heard are the white soldiers, settlers, evangelists, sympathizers, oppressors, and opportunists who witnessed their passage to what is now Oklahoma. The fictional testimony creates a graphic and compelling mosaic of human tragedy. Highly recommended. (<i>Library Journal - Starr E. Smith, Marymount Univ.

For Tyrion Lannister, the Imp&#x2014;whose stunted, twisted body houses the mind of a genius&#x2014;has but lately won his freedom from Lady Catelyn Stark, Eddard&#x2019;s wife, who had accused him of attempting to murder her youngest son, Brandon.

November 12, 2001, was another frigid arctic day in Oslo, with temperatures below zero. Inside the modest redbrick headquarters of the Scandinavian media publisher Schibsted, there was a distinct chill as well. Schibsted&#x2019;s board was convening to determine the future of CEO Kjell Aamot.<br><br> During the previous two years the company&#x2019;s main newspapers, Aftenposten and VG, had seen revenue declines as Web competitors siphoned off readers and advertisers. Schibsted&#x2019;s own online operations, started more than six years earlier, were growing but had little to show for themselves&#x2014;�investments far outpaced returns. And the recent bursting of the Internet bubble had seen Schibsted&#x2019;s stock crash and then languish. Aamot later summarized the situation with customary candor:<br><br> Everything was going wrong. We saw major loss-�making initiatives all over the place&#x2014;�seven years of losses. When the bubble burst, we had a loss of approximately $200 million in Norwegian kroners and that was a huge loss for us. That was absolutely my responsibility. The board of directors very much felt we should close down some activities. Most members were of the opinion that I should resign.<br><br> Ultimately, it was only the support of Schibsted&#x2019;s main shareholder, Tinius-�Nagell Erichsen, that allowed Aamot to continue. But the crisis shook the company&#x2019;s senior managers, resulting in greater pressure to clarify their Internet strategy.<br><br> As a print-media firm struggling to reckon with the threat of the Internet, Schibsted was not alone. Hundreds of newspapers around the world were engulfed in a digital wildfire. That year The New York Times announced cuts of up to 9 percent of its workforce; between 2001 and 2006 it lost more than half its market value, and by 2012 the loss was more than 75 percent. The Washington Post shed 23 percent of its newsroom, and similar cuts occurred at The Boston Globe. Articles with titles such as &#x201c;Who Killed the Newspaper?&#x201d; (The Economist, 2006) and &#x201c;Mourning Old Media&#x2019;s Decline&#x201d; (The New York Times, 2008) cropped up everywhere.<br><br> But as these events continued to unfold, something strange was happening back in Oslo. Starting in 2003, Schibsted began to make money on its online operations. A little at first&#x2014;�and then more and more. By 2006 the publisher&#x2019;s online operations accounted for 35 percent of operating profits. In a stunning reversal of events, Schibsted had, first shakily but then unmistakably, turned around. The Economist noted that while 2005 had been &#x201c;miserable&#x201d; for most newspaper companies in the Western world, Schibsted&#x2019;s performance was &#x201c;a rare exception,&#x201d; making it one of the only newspapers to have turned online into a profitable business. In 2011 Schibsted declared operating profits on its online businesses of roughly $220 million&#x2014;�nearly 60 percent that of the entire group.<br><br> Chinese Virtual Giants<br><br> Six thousand miles southeast of Oslo lies Shenzhen, one of China&#x2019;s&nbsp; fastest-growing cities. Three decades ago it was a farming and fishing village with a few thousand people. Today it is an eleven-�million-�person metropolis. Most of its growth was triggered by the creation of a Special Economic Zone in 1979. Shenzhen is now a manufacturing hub, the financial center of southern China, and the home of companies with globally recognized brands, like Huawei and ZTE. Despite this engineered growth, the most famous company headquartered there arose from homegrown entrepreneurs Pony Ma and Zhang Zidong.<br><br> In 1998 these two young computer science graduates of Shenzhen University started a company to take advantage of China&#x2019;s Internet boom. Tencent began operations uneventfully, engaging in service work for local telecom operators and paging centers. Like many other local start-�ups, its main approach to product development was to copy from the West.<br><br> It did so well: Its first product, the free instant messaging (IM) service OICQ, was a near-�perfect replica of AOL&#x2019;s ICQ (an acronym for &#x201c;I Seek You&#x201d;). In addition to an easy-�to-�navigate communications platform, OICQ offered useful add-�on features such as chat rooms and a mobile service. Within three years the service, renamed QQ, was the leading IM provider in China, with more than 50 million users. The entry of copycat providers did nothing to slow it down.<br><br> Instant messaging is a business that&#x2019;s very hard to monetize. Many have tried&#x2014;�and failed. And Tencent launched at the same time as hundreds of other Chinese start-�ups. But while most of those ventures struggled, Tencent&#x2019;s offerings grew from instant messaging and its associated iconic penguin mascot to an impressively broad suite: a social networking site, a news portal, a mobile platform, single-� and multi-�player games, and a microblogging service. Its most recent product, WeChat, was a mobile app that combined voice chat (similar to Skype), photo sharing (similar to Instagram), social network features (similar to Facebook), e-�commerce capabilities (similar to Amazon), group messaging, and walkie-�talkie features into a single offering&#x2014;�for free. By 2015 Tencent&#x2019;s products and services were used by more than a billion Chinese, who accessed them through mobile phones, personal computers, and Internet caf�s.<br><br> Like many e-�commerce sites, Tencent gave consumers the ability to purchase clothes, pets, guns, and food, but with one important caveat: All Tencent&#x2019;s products were virtual goods existing only in the online world and purchased predominantly with the firm&#x2019;s virtual currency&#x2014;�&#x201c;Q coins.&#x201d; Against this make-�believe backdrop, Tencent&#x2019;s financial strength was hardly imaginary. In 2015 revenue neared $16 billion&#x2014;�similar to Facebook&#x2019;s and more than three times as much as LinkedIn&#x2019;s and Twitter&#x2019;s combined. In April 2015 the firm&#x2019;s market capitalization passed $200 billion, making it the fourth most valuable Internet firm in the world, behind Google, Facebook, and Alibaba.<br><br> How does a Scandinavian newspaper company find lucrative revenue streams online when everyone else is struggling? How did Tencent overcome the brutal odds of starting as a free IM product and then translate its advantage there into numerous product categories over the next fifteen years? How does it get users to pay for products that exist only in an imaginary world? And what generalizable lessons can we draw from these examples?<br><br> On the face of it, the stories of Schibsted and Tencent could not be more different. One firm resides in a Western developed economy, the other in an Eastern emerging market. One exemplifies traditional media, the other was a digital start-�up. One is run by executives with more than thirty years of experience in media, the other by thirty-�somethings who&#x2019;ve never known anything but the Internet. But the stories are inextricably linked.<br><br> The link isn&#x2019;t the superior quality of products or the ability to innovate and bring new offerings to market first. The link is the ability to recognize and manage connections across users. This principle&#x2014;�user connections&#x2014;�is a critical concept for media, technology, and Internet organizations. But few get it right.<br><br> To unpack the concept, let&#x2019;s start by returning to newspapers.<br><br> 2<br><br> The Real Problem&nbsp; with Newspapers<br><br> Newspapers seem to be a dying breed. The common reason given is clear: &#x201c;Readers are migrating online!&#x201d; And why wouldn&#x2019;t they? Online news is mostly free. It is accessible anytime, anywhere. It is updated frequently. It can be personalized. It is interactive and searchable. It&#x2019;s hard to think of another product where the digital version seems so vastly superior. Clearly, these factors are the reason for the havoc wreaked on the news industry.<br><br> Except that they aren&#x2019;t. The real story is different.<br><br> Figure 2 shows the steady decline over time in U.S. newspaper readership by household.<br><br> The decline is sobering and perhaps unsurprising in light of the Internet. But now consider the same data again with dates filled in (Figure 3):<br><br> The drop in readership can&#x2019;t be pinned on digital alternatives; it&#x2019;s been under way for sixty years.<br><br> It began with the introduction of radio&#x2014;�and free news bulletins&#x2014;�during the 1950s, continued with the launch of television broadcast networks in the 1960s, and then persisted with the introduction of cable TV and 24/7 news channels during the 1980s. But the central point remains the same: The impact of the Internet on newspaper readership is empirically indistinguishable from the factors that came before.<br><br> The real reasons for the newspaper problem lie elsewhere.<br><br> One factor is the cost structure of a typical newspaper. Most of a newspaper&#x2019;s costs are what economists call &#x201c;fixed costs&#x201d;&#x2014;�borne regardless of the number of readers. These are the costs of staff journalists, printing facilities, and administrative and distribution overhead&#x2014;�all the things needed to write, print, and deliver the paper to your door. Fixed costs are terrific during periods of growth&#x2014;�increase your readership by a few thousand and revenue goes up while fixed costs remain the same, so you can spread these costs over more users. For the same reason, they are devastating during periods of decline&#x2014;�lose just 3 percent of your readers and the revenue drop goes directly to your bottom line.<br><br> At first glance, fixed costs offer an explanation for why newspapers have suffered during the Internet era&#x2014;�but do they really? Although per-�household readership declined during the 1950s, &#x2019;60s, and &#x2019;70s, overall population grew; then when population growth slowed beginning in the 1980s, so did aggregate newspaper readership. Even then, things weren&#x2019;t so bad: Many newspapers increased their prices, offsetting the decline in readership. For the top twenty-�five newspapers, prices increased by an average of 50 percent in real terms during the past two decades, causing circulation revenues to increase between 1994 and 2012, even as readership fell. So fixed costs aren&#x2019;t the culprit; it must be something else.<br><br> That brings us to a subtler but far more important problem, one that has to do with connections, not content or cost structure. It relates to how newspapers structure advertising.<br><br> Most newspapers contain two kinds of advertising: retail ads (the near-�full-�page ads for Macy&#x2019;s on page three of The New York Times) and classifieds (the car ads, job listings, and real estate ads tucked away in the back sections). While retail advertising increased slightly between 1994 and 2008, classified advertising fell by 20 percent. The differences were even starker since the year 2000, when newspaper revenues reached their peak. From 2000 to 2010, fully 74 percent of classified advertising revenue disappeared from U.S. newspapers&#x2014;�nearly double the decrease in retail advertising, which was 39 percent.<br><br> The decline in classified advertising isn&#x2019;t, by itself, surprising. It&#x2019;s the difference in revenue declines between classifieds, retail advertising, and news circulation that&#x2019;s striking. All three were vulnerable to the same threats from online offerings: real-�time updating, better searchability, greater variety, richer media formats, anytime-�and-�anywhere access, lower prices. Yet classifieds declined much more sharply. The table below summarizes this puzzle:<br><br> Table 1. The Online Threat for Different Parts of a Newspaper<br><br> NewsClassifieds<br><br> Real-�time updatingyesyes<br><br> Easier to searchyesyes<br><br> Greater varietyyesyes<br><br> Video formatyesyes<br><br> Anytime-�anywhere accessyesyes<br><br> Lower pricesyesyes<br><br> Revenue declinessmallmassive<br><br> Why would classified revenue alone go into free fall whereas circulation revenues did not? The answer lies in user behavior.<br><br> A reader goes to the news site that offers the best news for her. But a classifieds &#x201c;buyer&#x201d; goes to where the most listings are. In the first case, the purchase decision is based on content quality and features. In the second, it is based first and foremost on the number of advertisers listing their wares.<br><br> This simple difference has profound implications. While the economics of news depends on attracting readers one by one, the economics of classifieds is about connections between buyers and sellers. These come from &#x201c;positive feedback loops,&#x201d; or as they&#x2019;re often referred to, a &#x201c;network effect&#x201d;: The more listings you have, the more buyers you attract, who in turn attract more listings. So while the decision to read print versus online news is made one reader at a time, the decision to go to a print versus an online classifieds site is determined by the choices of many.<br><br> As a result, engage in a news battle and you are competing tooth and nail for every new reader in the market&#x2014;�no matter how big you are. Engage in a classifieds battle and positive feedback loops generate greater and greater market shares for the leader, such that it eventually wins the entire market.<br><br> This means that Google, CNN.com, news blogs, and all the rest weren&#x2019;t the real problem for newspapers. In fact readers are migrating to online news very slowly. Average weekly print readership for The New York Times declined by 7 percent from 1994 to 2006 (the first thirteen years of the Internet era)&#x2014;�an average of just 0.5 percent a year. Incorporating figures from 2008 to 2011, a period including the worst recession in eighty years, raises the figure to roughly 1.5 percent. In other words, just one or two of every 100 print readers of the Times defected every year during the Internet era. Other major papers had similar results.<br><br> The real culprits were sites such as Monster.com, Craigslist, and Trader Online. Although the Internet changed many things for news&#x2014;�production and distribution costs, ease of search and access, and price&#x2014;�the feedback loop for classifieds was unaltered. Feedback loops&#x2014;�in particular, the winner-�take-�all effect of classifieds&#x2014;�were the reason most towns in America had only one paper: it wasn&#x2019;t that only one outlet in every town knew how to produce the news. And they were the reason that once classifieds started moving online, they moved very rapidly.<br><br> Go to any conference on the future of news and you&#x2019;ll hear calls for greater subsidies for news organizations because of the increasingly fierce digital threat. Understand the classifieds dynamic, however, and you&#x2019;ll see that the real problem is that newspapers were always subsidized&#x2014;�until recently. The Internet didn&#x2019;t kill news; it destroyed the classifieds subsidy. Where news organizations went wrong was not in failing to deliver faster, cheaper, better news online&#x2014;�to believe that is to fall into the Content Trap&#x2014;�but in failing to protect the classifieds subsidy or to profitably manage its migration online. Papers were beaten to the punch in capturing user connections in the digital arena.<br><br> Miss that connection, as most newspapers did, and no matter how robust or creative your online news strategy, you would be trying to solve the wrong problem. Recognize that connection, as some companies did&#x2014;�a story we&#x2019;ll return to shortly&#x2014;�and the payoff can be spectacular.</p><h2>Truth Matters: Confident Faith in a Confusing World</h2><p>In an interview with Christianity Today in 2012, Ed Stetzer shared that according to LifeWay research among young adults who had attended church regularly for at least a year in high school, 70% stop attending regularly for at least a year between ages 18-22. However, 35% of these had returned to attending twice a month or more by the time they were surveyed for the study. This means that about 4 out of 10 kids leave the church and NEVER RETURN.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here is how leading experts describe our church kids today: They are unarmed and incapable of defending their faith. They possess a faith that cannot withstand the scrutiny of trials or intellectual questions. They have a shallow belief system. They lack a robust faith. They haven&#x2019;t learned how to think. They are embarrassingly ignorant of our faith.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Truth Matters</i> is written directly to this audience, arming them with well-reasoned responses to the accusations that are most likely to appear in their lives, either as upcoming lecture notes and test questions or as inner qualms and questions. Things like: What gives the Bible any authority or credibility? Where is God in a world full of suffering? Why should Christianity be any more believable than any other religious system? And many, many more.<br>&nbsp;<br>Easy to read yet loaded with meat and substance, this book is a level-headed reaction to those who equate Christian faith with &#x201c;blind faith,&#x201d; even those whose subtle or stated goal is to separate students from their religious traditions. Readers will discover the kind of historical information and thinking skills that build a sturdy backbone of confidence in high schoolers and young adults, making them able to defend by &#x201c;reasoned faith&#x201d; what the Bible claims as truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Loosely organized around the theological skepticism of New York Times bestselling author (and southern college educator) Bart Ehrman, this jam-packed counterclaim is a book that parents will want to buy for their kids, a book that youth and student leaders will want to work through one-on-one and in discipleship groups&#x2015;a book that could prove a lifesaver for young minds and hearts everywhere.</p><p><b>Andreas K�stenberger</b> (Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is senior research professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Darrell Bock</b> (Ph.D., University of Aberdeen) is executive director of Cultural Engagement and senior research professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Josh Chatraw </b>(Ph.D., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) is the pastor of Preaching and Students at First Baptist Church in Dublin, Ga.What I love about this book is that it is both intellectually responsible and imminently readable.

Each family has their very own &#x201c;Lazarus,&#x201d; a cybernetic warrior pledged to carry out the family&#x2019;s dirty work on their path to control their population. Our protagonist is the Lazarus and daughter of the Carlyle family, Forever &#x201c;Eve&#x201d; Carlyle, who appears to have far more depth than her role as coldhearted killer would initially suggest. The more information Rucka unfurls about the political dealings of each family, the more it becomes scattered with betrayal, power struggles, and corruption.

He is the #1 internationally bestselling author of many critically acclaimed novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Accident, Never Look Away, Fear the Worst, Too Close to Home,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;No Time for Goodbye</i>. Multiple titles<i>&nbsp;</i>have been optioned for film.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Cynthia stood out front of the two-story house on Hickory. It wasn't as though she was seeing her childhood home for the first time in nearly twenty-five years. She still lived in Milford. She'd driven by here once in a while. She showed me the house once before we got married, a quick drive-by. "There it is," she said, and kept on going. She rarely stopped. And if she did, she didn't get out. She'd never stood on the sidewalk and stared at the place.<br><br>And it had certainly been a very long time since she'd stepped through that front door.<br>She was rooted to the sidewalk, seemingly unable to take even one step toward the place. I wanted to go to her side, walk her to the door. It was only a thirty-foot driveway, but it stretched a quarter century into the past. I was guessing, to Cynthia, it must have been like looking through the wrong end of some binoculars. You could walk all day and never get there.<br><br>But I stayed where I was, on the other side of the street, looking at her back, at her short red hair. I had my orders.<br><br>Cynthia stood there, as though waiting for permission to approach. And then it came.<br><br>"Okay, Mrs. Archer? Start walking toward the house. Not too fast. Kind of hesitant, you know, like it's the first time you've gone inside since you were fourteen years old."<br><br>Cynthia glanced over her shoulder at a woman in jeans and sneakers, her ponytail pulled down and through the opening at the back of her ball cap. She was one of three assistant producers. "This is the first time," Cynthia said.<br><br>"Yeah yeah, don't look at me," Ponytail Girl said. "Just look at the house and start walking up the drive, thinking back to that time, twenty-five years ago, when it all happened, okay?"<br>Cynthia glanced across the street at me, made a face, and I smiled back weakly, a kind of mutual what-are-you-gonna-do?<br>&nbsp;<br>And so she started up the driveway, slowly. If the camera hadn't been on, is this how she would have approached? With this mixture of deliberation and apprehension? Probably. But now it felt false, forced. <br><br>But as she mounted the steps to the door, reached out with her hand, I could just make out the trembling. An honest emotion, which meant, I guessed, that the camera would fail to catch it.<br>She had her hand on the knob, turned it, was about to push the door open, when Ponytail Girl shouted, "Okay! Good! Just hold it there!" Then, to her cameraman, "Okay, let's set up inside, get her coming in."<br><br>"You're fucking kidding me," I said, loud enough for the crew&#x2014;a half dozen or so, plus Paula Malloy, she of the gleaming teeth and Donna Karan suits, who was doing all the on-camera stuff and voiceovers&#x2014;to hear.<br><br>Paula herself came over to see me.<br><br>"Mr. Archer," she said, reaching out with both hands and touching me just below my shoulders, a Malloy trademark, "is everything okay?"<br><br>"How can you do that to her?" I said. "My wife's walking in there for the first time since her family fucking vanished, and you basically yell 'Cut'?"<br><br>"Terry," she said, insinuating herself closer to me. "May I call you Terry?"<br><br>I said nothing.<br><br>"Terry, I'm sorry, we have to get the camera in position, and we want the look on Cynthia's face, when she comes into the house after all these years, we want that to be genuine. We want this to be honest. I think that's what both of you want as well."<br><br>That was a good one. That a reporter from the TV news/entertainment show Deadline&#x2014;which, when it wasn't revisiting bizarre _unsolved crimes from years past, was chasing after the latest drinking-and-driving celebrity, or hunting down a pop star who'd failed to buckle her toddler into a seat belt&#x2014;would play the honesty card.<br>&nbsp; <br>"Sure," I said tiredly, thinking of the bigger picture here, that maybe after all these years, some TV exposure might finally provide Cynthia with some answers. "Sure, whatever."<br><br>Paula showed some perfect teeth and went briskly back across the street, her high heels clicking along the pavement. <br><br>I'd been doing my best to stay out of the way since Cynthia and I'd arrived here. I'd arranged to get the day off from school. My principal and longtime friend, Rolly Carruthers, knew how important it was to Cynthia to do this show, and he'd arranged a substitute teacher to take my English and creative writing classes. Cynthia had taken the day off from Pamela's, the dress shop where she worked. We'd dropped off our eight-year-old daughter, Grace, at school along the way. Grace would have been intrigued, watching a film crew do its thing, but her introduction to TV production was not going to be a segment on her own mother's personal tragedy.<br><br>The people who lived in the house now, a retired couple who'd moved down here from Hartford a decade ago to be close to their boat in the Milford harbor, had been paid off by the producers to clear out for the day so they could have the run of the place. Then the crew had gone about removing distracting knickknacks and personal photos from the walls, trying to make the house look, if not the way it looked when Cynthia lived there, at least as generic as possible.<br><br>Before the owners took off for a day of sailing, they'd said a few things on the front lawn for the cameras.<br><br>Husband: "It's hard to imagine, what might have happened here, in this house, back then. You wonder, were they all cut up into bits in the basement or something?"<br><br>Wife: "Sometimes, I think I hear voices, you know? Like the ghosts of them are still walking around the house. I'll be sitting at the kitchen table, and I get this chill, like maybe the mother or the father, or the boy, has walked past."<br><br>Husband: "We didn't even know, when we bought the house, what had happened here. Someone else had got it from the girl, and they sold it to someone else, and then we bought it from them, but when I found what happened here, I read up on it at the Milford library, and you have to wonder, how come she was spared? Huh? It seems a bit odd, don't you think?"<br><br>Cynthia, watching this from around the corner of one of the show's trucks, shouted, "Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?"<br><br>One of the crew whirled around, said, "Shush," but Cynthia would have none of it. "Don't you fucking shush me," she said. To the husband, she called out, "What are you implying?"<br><br>The man looked over, startled. He must have had no idea that the person he was talking about was actually present. The ponytail producer took Cynthia by the elbow and ushered her gently, but firmly, around the back of the truck.<br><br>"What kind of horseshit is that?" Cynthia asked. "What's he trying to say? That I had something to do with my family's disappearance? I've put up with that shit for so&#x2014;"<br><br>"Don't worry about him," the producer said.&nbsp; <br><br>"You said the whole point of doing this was to help me," Cynthia said. "To help me find out what happened to them. That's the only reason I agreed to do this. Are you going to run that? What he said? What are people going to think when they hear him saying that?"<br><br>"Don't worry about it," the producer assured her. "We're not going to use that."<br><br>They must have been scared Cynthia was going to walk at that point, before they had even a minute of her on film, so there were plenty of reassurances, cajoling, promises that once this piece went on TV, for sure someone who knew something would see it. Happened all the time, they said. They'd closed cold cases for the cops all over the country, they said.<br><br>Once they had again persuaded Cynthia that their intentions were honorable, and the old farts who lived in the house had been whisked away, the show went on.&nbsp; <br><br>I followed two cameramen into the house, then got out of the way as they positioned themselves to catch Cynthia's expressions of apprehension and deja vu from different angles. I figured that once this was on TV, there'd be lots of fast editing, maybe they'd turn the image all grainy, dig around in their bag of tricks to bring more drama to an event that TV producers in decades past would have found plenty dramatic on its own.<br><br>They led Cynthia upstairs to her old bedroom. She looked numb. They wanted footage of her walking into it, but Cynthia had to do it twice. The first time, the cameraman was waiting inside her bedroom, the door closed, to get a shot of Cynthia entering the room, ever so tentatively. Then they did it again, this time from the hall, the camera looking over her shoulder as she went into the room. When it aired, you could see they'd used some fish-eye lens or something to make the scene spookier, like maybe we were going to find Jason in a goalie mask hiding behind the door.<br><br>Paula Malloy, who'd started out as a weather girl, got her makeup retouched and her blond hair repouffed. Then she and Cynthia had those little microphone packs attached to the backs of their skirts, the wires run up and under their blouses and clipped just below their collars. Paula let her shoulder rub up against Cynthia's, like they were old friends reminiscing, reluctantly, about the bad times instead of the good.<br><br>As they came into the kitchen, cameras rolling, Paula asked, "What must you have been thinking?" Cynthia appeared to be walking through a dream. "You hadn't heard a sound in the house so far, your brother's not upstairs, you come down here into the kitchen and there's no sign of life at all."<br>"I didn't know what was happening," Cynthia said quietly. "I thought everyone had left early. That my dad was gone to work, that my mother must have taken my brother to school. I thought they must be mad at me, for misbehaving the night before."<br><br>"You were a difficult teen?" Paula asked.<br><br>"I had . . . my moments. I'd been out the night before, with a boy my parents didn't approve of, I'd had something to drink. But I wasn't like some kids. I mean, I loved my parents, and I think"&#x2014;her voice breaking a bit here&#x2014;"they loved me."<br><br>"We read in the police reports from the time, from the statements that you'd made, that you'd had an argument with your parents."<br><br>"Yes," Cynthia said. "About not being home when I promised, lying to them. I said some awful things."<br><br>"Like what?"<br><br>"Oh," Cynthia hesitated, "you know. Kids can say pretty hateful things to their parents that they don't really mean."<br><br>"And where do you think they are, today, two and a half decades later?"<br><br>Cynthia shook her head sadly. "It's all I ask myself. There's not a day goes by I don't wonder."<br><br>"If you could say something to them, right now, here on Deadline, if somehow they are still alive, what would it be?"<br><br>Cynthia, nonplussed, looked somewhat hopelessly out the kitchen window.<br><br>"Look into the camera there," Paula Malloy said, putting her hand around Cynthia's shoulder. I was off to the side, and it was all I could do not to step into the frame and peel Paula's artificial face off. <br><br>"Just ask them what you've been waiting all these years to ask them."<br><br>Cynthia, her eyes shiny, did as she was told, looked to the camera, and managed, at first, to say nothing more than "Why?"<br><br>Paula allowed for a dramatic pause, then asked, "Why what, Cynthia?"<br><br>"Why," she repeated, trying to compose herself, "did you have to leave me? If you're able to, if you're alive, why haven't you gotten in touch? Why couldn't you have left just a simple note? Why couldn't you have at least said goodbye?"<br><br>I could feel the electricity among the crew, the producers. No one was breathing. I knew what they were thinking. This was their money shot. This was going to be fucking awesome TV. I hated them for exploiting Cynthia's misery, for milking her suffering for entertainment purposes. Because that's what this was, ultimately. Entertainment. But I held my tongue, because I knew Cynthia probably understood all this, too, that they were taking advantage of her, that she was just another story to them, a way to fill up another half-hour show. She was willing to be exploited if it meant someone watching would step forward with the key to unlock her past.<br><br>At the show's request, Cynthia had brought with her two dented cardboard shoeboxes of memories. Newspaper clippings, faded Polaroid photos, class pictures, report cards, all the bits and pieces that she'd managed to take from her house before she moved from it and went to live with her aunt, her mother's sister, a woman named Tess Berman.<br><br>They had Cynthia sit at the kitchen table, the boxes open in front of her, taking out one memory and then another, laying them out as if starting to begin a jigsaw puzzle, looking for all the pieces with straight edges, trying to assemble the border, then work toward the middle.<br><br>But there were no border pieces in Cynthia's shoeboxes. No way to work toward the center. Instead of having a thousand pieces to a single puzzle, it was like she had a single piece from a thousand different puzzles. <br><br>"This is us," she said, showing off a Polaroid, "on a camping trip we took up in Vermont." The camera zoomed in on a disheveled-looking Todd and Cynthia standing on either side of their mother, a tent in the background. Cynthia looked about five, her brother seven, their faces smudged with earth, their mother smiling proudly, her hair wrapped in a red-and-white-checked kerchief. <br><br>"I don't have any pictures of my father," she said mournfully. "He always took the pictures of the rest of us, so now I just have to remember how he looked. And I still see him, standing tall, always in his hat, that fedora, that little hint of a mustache. A handsome man. Todd took after him."<br><br>She reached for a yellowed piece of newsprint. "Here's a clipping," Cynthia said, unfolding it gingerly, "from some things I found in my _father's drawer, what little was there." The camera moved in again, scanned the square of newspaper. It was a faded, grainy black-and-white picture of a school basketball team. A dozen boys faced the camera, some smiling, some making stupid faces. "Dad must have saved it because Todd was in it, when he was littler, although they left his name out of the caption. He was proud of us, Dad was. He told us all the time. He liked to joke that we were the best family that he'd ever had."<br><br>They interviewed my principal, Rolly Carruthers.<br><br>"It's a mystery," he said. "I knew Clayton Bigge. We went fishing together a couple of times. He was a good man. I can't imagine what happened to them. Maybe there was some kind of Manson family, you know, heading across country, and Cynthia's family, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time?"<br><br>They interviewed Aunt Tess.<br><br>"I lost a sister, a brother-in-law, a nephew," she said. "But Cynthia, her loss was so much greater. She managed to beat the odds, to still turn out to be a great kid, a great person."</p><h2>Sweet Tea Revenge (A Tea Shop Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the latest novel from the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Agony of the Leaves</i>, Indigo Tea Shop owner Theodosia Browning may always be a bridesmaid, never a bride, but this groom is never going to make it to the altar...</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Theodosia Browning&#x2019;s dear friend Delaine Dish has asked her to be a bridesmaid for her wedding.

Yet she refuses to forget her best friend Elizabeth, whom she is convinced is missing and in terrible danger.</p><p>But no one will listen to Maud&#x2014;not her frustrated daughter, Helen, not her caretakers, not the police, and especially not Elizabeth&#x2019;s mercurial son, Peter. Armed with handwritten notes she leaves for herself and an overwhelming feeling that Elizabeth needs her help, Maud resolves to discover the truth and save her beloved friend.</p><p>This singular obsession forms a cornerstone of Maud&#x2019;s rapidly dissolving present. But the clues she discovers seem only to lead her deeper into her past, to another unsolved disappearance: her sister, Sukey, who vanished shortly after World War II.</p><p>As vivid memories of a tragedy that occurred more fifty years ago come flooding back, Maud discovers new momentum in her search for her friend. Could the mystery of Sukey&#x2019;s disappearance hold the key to finding Elizabeth?</p></p><p>Kimberly McCreight Emma Healey <p><b></b></p> <b>Kimberly McCreight, author of the New York Times bestselling Reconstructing Amelia, interviews Emma Healey</b> <p></p> <p>Kimberly McCreight (KM): One of the things I most admire about Elizabeth is Missing&#x2014;and there is so much to admire&#x2014;is the utterly convincing voice of Maud, both in her advanced years and when she is much younger. How did you tackle the challenge of presenting a single character at such disparate times within a single narrative? </p> <p>Emma Healey (EH): I&#x2019;m so glad it&#x2019;s convincing, thank you. I started with Maud&#x2019;s voice as an eighty-year-old and found that only needed a little adjusting to take her back into childhood. The voice overall is very much based on my mother&#x2019;s mother, Vera. I was very close to her and she had (ironically) a brilliant memory and had lots of stories to tell about her early life. I spent most of my school holidays with her, so remembering and sticking to the kind of words she would have used gave me a guide for Maud&#x2019;s lexicon. Voice is so much about vocabulary. I do have to say though, I think writing from the point-of-view of a single character, even in two time frames, is much easier than swapping between characters. Reading Reconstructing Amelia, I am amazed at how well you alternate a first-person and third-person narrative, from the point-of-view of a teenager and a mother, as well as using Facebook statuses and text messages, all in one novel. I should be asking you how you made that work so well!</p> <p> KM: Was there something that drew you to writing about a character losing her grip on reality, particularly one struggling with dementia?</p> <p>EH: The initial inspiration for the book came from my father's mother, Nancy, who has multi-infarct dementia, but my aunt&#x2019;s mother-in-law had suffered from Alzheimer&#x2019;s for several years before that and other members of my family had had various forms of dementia. At the time, dementia wasn&#x2019;t something that was being talked about so much and I was fascinated (as well as terrified and upset) by the way a person could come and go&#x2014;one minute their old selves, the next in a world of their own. Their patterns of behavior could be anything from perfectly reasonable to completely bizarre and it seemed like there was a lot more going on under the surface, which was difficult to discover or explain, and this seemed ripe for fictional exploration.</p> <p> KM: Elizabeth is Missing has such a smooth, flawless structure. You move so nimbly through time, without relying on chapter breaks or some such device to delineate different sections. It works so well that I think any demarcations would have interfered with the story. Can you talk a bit about the decision to include chapters that switch back and forth through time? </p> <p>EH: Thank you. Again, I&#x2019;m really glad you think so. The structure happened fairly organically. I felt that a dialogue between current and past events was truer to the way memories work &#x2013; they break into your immediate thoughts, rather than wait for you to decide to have them &#x2013; and I wanted the sections to be relatively short in order to mirror the fragmentary experience of dementia. Not dividing the past and present into separate chapters made it easier too to increase the length of the past story as Maud&#x2019;s preoccupation with it intensified (and as her awareness of the world around her faded), without signaling too heavily to the reader and without losing the thread or balance of either narrative.</p> <p>KM: Your book is both a compelling emotional story as well as a mystery. Which comes first for you?</p> <p>EH: I find plotting a book very exciting, and really enjoy trying to weave in narrative strands and tie up all the ends, but I have to feel there is some real experience behind the story, some &#x201c;truth&#x201d; that I&#x2019;m attempting to represent, too. And these two things seem to me to be inextricably linked. It&#x2019;s much easier to engage emotionally when there is an intriguing story unfolding &#x2013; a dull character or a character in a dull situation is difficult to take an interest in, even if they are sympathetic. Similarly, for a mystery to work and for the reader to care whether, and how, it is solved, there needs to be a certain amount of emotional investment in the characters and themes.</p> <p>KM: I couldn&#x2019;t agree more. There needs to be a constant dialogue between character and story. Trying to achieve that balance is, for me, one of the greatest joys and the greatest challenges of being a novelist. What's your biggest challenge as a writer?</p> <p>EH: Being a writer means being constantly mentally engaged. This is great in some ways as it&#x2019;s exciting and gives a context and significance to every aspect of life, but it also means there are no off-duty hours. So anytime I&#x2019;m not writing (or not observing, listening, note-taking), I&#x2019;m feeling guilty about it. Justifying writing is sometimes difficult, too: Why this subject? Why this character? But most of all, why me? What can I offer that another writer couldn&#x2019;t? A terrible question because the answer is invariably nothing.</p> <p>KM: You&#x2019;re right, that &#x201c;why&#x201d; is very important. It inevitably pushes your story to a much stronger place. What's your background? Elizabeth is Missing is such an accomplished debut, I'm assuming&#x2014;okay, maybe hoping&#x2014;there was some writing that came before it. Otherwise, I might be far too jealous.</p> <p>EH: Ha ha! Well, I wrote lots of bits of things, of course, but I hadn&#x2019;t really finished anything before Elizabeth is Missing. My first degree was in Book Arts, and the course did offer a Creative Writing module, but I was too shy to take it. Instead, I learned how to sew pages together and foil block and print. I was always an avid reader though, and I began to take short courses in writing and editing after I graduated and started the novel while I was working in an art gallery in London. I also found a workshop group, which was brilliant and gave me the confidence to experiment and find Maud&#x2019;s voice. Eventually, I went back to university to get my MA in Creative Writing at UEA.</p> <p>KM: Well, I certainly can&#x2019;t wait to see what you do next. Best wishes with Elizabeth is Missing.

Challenging the reductionist division of people by race, religion, and class, Sen presents an inspiring vision of a world that can be made to move toward peace as firmly as it has spiraled in recent years toward brutality and war.</p><p>Amartya Sen has written many books, including Development as Freedom and The Argumentative Indian. He won the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. A professor at Harvard University, he lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Cambridge, England.Nowadays the economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen travels the world, opinions at the ready. His subjects are rarely economic. In the main, he works "out of area," taking on a wide range of political and social issues that have little to do with the dismal science. He is serene and confident, full of good cheer, ready to see the best in everyone.<p> Over this discursive little book lies the shadow of Sen's formidable Harvard colleague, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, with his celebrated theory of the "clash of civilizations." Sen has assigned himself the role of the anti-Huntington: Sen sees Huntington's thesis of cultural conflict yielding a one-dimensional approach to human identity -- and leading to the "civilizational and religious partitioning of the world," which can only occasion greater global disorder. </p><p>ere, in contrast, is Sen celebrating the complexity of human identity: "The same person can be, without any contradiction, an American citizen, of Caribbean origin, with African ancestry, a Christian, a liberal, a woman, a vegetarian, a long-distance runner, a historian, a schoolteacher, a novelist, a feminist, a heterosexual, a believer in gay and lesbian rights, a theater lover, an environmental activist, a tennis fan, a jazz musician," etc. One's civilizational identity is not one's destiny, Sen observes, and civilizational "partitioning" -- seeing the planet culture by culture -- does not capture the messiness of the world. This Earth of ours, he says, is made more "flammable" by warring definitions of human identity, rather than an embrace of the many different facets that make us human. </p><p>Sen's faith in the multiplicity of claims on human loyalty is admirable, but it can hardly stand up to the fury of the true believers. In our combustible world today, Huntington's outlook has much greater power. His "cartography" of civilizations may have been too sharply drawn and he may have been a bit cavalier about modernity's appeal across cultural lines, but he came forth with a formidable work. Nor did he fail to see the fissures at the heart of particular societies -- hence his category of "torn countries," places like Turkey, Russia and Mexico, where the matter of loyalty and identity is fiercely contested. But Sen needs his straw man, and Huntington is pressed into the role.</p><p> Sen is a product of Western (British) education. But he sees no clear demarcation between the West and the rest (the language is Huntington's). There is nothing peculiarly Western about democracy, Sen argues. It has global roots; there were antecedents of it in India and in the Muslim world at about the same time when "Inquisitions were quite extensive in Europe, and heretics were still being burned at the stake." In his most intensely argued assertion, Sen sees the democratic inheritance as a truly universal enterprise. "The Western world has no proprietary right over democratic ideas," he writes. "While modern institutional forms of democracy are relatively new everywhere, the history of democracy in the form of public participation and reasoning is spread across the world." Western practice was not "sequestered" then, and it has not developed in some "splendid isolation." </p><p> It is the unease of Islam, of course, and the violence of some of its radical adherents that have given the question of identity its contemporary global relevance. On that issue Huntington was at his most prophetic, writing of Islam's "bloody borders" and of the "youth bulge" in Muslim societies that had unhinged and radicalized the Muslim world. He did so in the early 1990s, and then history -- 9/11 and all that followed -- provided his thesis with cruel compliance. </p><p>Sen, however, wishes to rescue Islam from this "confinement." He makes his way through Islam's history and its wide geographic sweep in order to find great Muslim practitioners of tolerance and periods of genuine enlightenment. There is Akbar, the great Mughal emperor, who "insisted in the 1590s on the need for open dialogue and free choice, and also arranged recurrent discussions involving not only mainstream Muslim and Hindu thinkers, but also Christians, Jews, Parsees, Jains, and even atheists." In the face of the anti-Semitic bigotry of today's radical Islamism, Sen offers the example of Muslim rule in C�rdoba and the Iberian Peninsula -- that time of convivencia, where a Judeo-Islamic civilization in court life, letters and philosophy had a genuine flowering. </p><p> Sen works with the anecdote: His potted history is tailored for interfaith dialogues. He writes of the great Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who, when forced to emigrate from "an intolerant Europe" in the 12th century, was able to find "a tolerant refuge in the Arab world" in the court of the great Muslim ruler Saladin. But this will not do as history. Maimonides, born in 1135, did not flee "Europe" for the "Arab world": He fled his native C�rdoba in Spain, which was then in the grip of religious-political terror, choking under the yoke of a Berber Muslim dynasty, the Almohads, that was to snuff out all that remained of the culture of convivencia and made the life of Spain's Jews (and of the free spirits among its Muslims) utter hell. Maimonides and his family fled the fire of the Muslim city-states in the Iberian Peninsula to Morocco and then to Jerusalem. There was darkness and terror in Morocco as well, and Jerusalem was equally inhospitable in the time of the Crusader Kingdom. Deliverance came only in Cairo -- the exception, not the rule, its social peace maintained by the enlightened Saladin. </p><p>Here, for Sen's benefit, is a passage from Maimonides's seminal Epistle to Yemen: "Our hearts are weakened, our minds are confused, and our strength wanes because of the dire misfortunes that have come upon us in the form of religious persecution in the two ends of the world, the East and the West." Maimonides's geography was Islamic: The East in the Epistle was Yemen, then a battleground between Sunni and Shiite Islam, a place where Jews were being subjected to forced conversions to Islam; the Western lands were the burning grounds of Andalusia. The Almohads' pitiless warriors were in every way the Taliban of their age, the ancestors of today's religious radicals in the world of Islam. They put to the sword the fabled world of Andalusian tolerance, and young Maimonides witnessed the shattering collapse of that culture. There had been Andalusian bliss, and Muslim rulers with Jewish courtiers and poets, and philosophers who believed in the primacy of reason, but that world was scorched. </p><p>Inspirational history can go only so far; it will not bend to Sen's good cheer.</p><p>Reviewed by Fouad Ajami <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

In wide-ranging conversations held over a year and a half, organizational learning pioneers Peter Senge, C. Otto Scharmer, Joseph Jaworski, and Betty Sue Flowers explored the nature of transformational change&#x2014;how it arises, and the fresh possibilities it offers a world dangerously out of balance. The book introduces the idea of &#x201c;presence&#x201d;&#x2014;a concept&nbsp;borrowed from the natural world&nbsp;that the whole is entirely present in any of its parts&#x2014;to the worlds of business, education, government, and leadership. Too often, the authors found, we remain stuck in old patterns of seeing and acting. By encouraging deeper levels of learning, we create an awareness of the larger whole, leading to actions that can help to shape its evolution and our future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on the wisdom and experience of 150 scientists, social leaders, and entrepreneurs, including Brian Arthur, Rupert Sheldrake, Buckminster Fuller, Lao Tzu, and Carl Jung,&nbsp;<i>Presence</i> is both revolutionary in its exploration and hopeful in its message.&nbsp;This astonishing and completely original work goes on to define the capabilities that underlie our ability to see, sense, and realize new possibilities&#x2014;in ourselves, in our institutions and organizations, and in society itself.</p><p><i>Presence</i> can be read as a both a guide and a challenge to leaders in business, education, and government to transform their institutions into powerful agents of change in a world increasingly out of balance. Since business is the most powerful institution in the world today, the authors argue, it must play a key role in solving global societal problems. Yet so many institutions seem to run people rather than the other way around. In this illuminating book, the authors seek to understand why people don't change systems and institutions even when they pose a threat to society, and examine why institutional change is so difficult to attain. <p> The authors view large institutions such as global corporations as a new species that are affecting nearly all other life forms on the planet. Rather than look at these systems as merely the extension of a few hyper-powerful individuals, they see them as a dynamic organisms with the potential to learn, grow, and evolve--but only if people exert control over them and actively eliminate their destructive aspects. "But until that potential is activated," they write, "industrial age institutions will continue to expand blindly, unaware of their part in a larger whole or of the consequences of their growth." For global institutions to be recreated in positive ways, there must be individual and collective levels of awareness, followed by direct action. Raising this awareness is what <i>Presence</i> seeks to achieve. Drawing on the insights gleaned from interviews with over 150 leading scientists, social leaders, and entrepreneurs, the authors emphasize what they call the "courage to see freshly"--the ability to view familiar problems from a new perspective in order to better understand how parts and wholes are interrelated. </p><p> This is not a typical business book. Mainly theoretical, it does not offer specific tips that organizational managers or directors can apply immediately; rather, it offers powerful tools and ideas for changing the mindset of leaders and unlocking the latent potential to "develop awareness commensurate with our impact, wisdom in balance with our power." <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Peter Senge</b> is a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the founding chair of SoL, a renowned pioneer, theorist, and writer in the field of management innovation, and the author of the widely acclaimed book, <i>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</i> (Doubleday/Currency, 1990). <b>C.

Written in the early 1940s for a collector at a dollar a page, the erotica was also given to agents to sell far and wide. Auletris was sold to Milton Lubovitsky in 1950; Lubovitsky typed up five copies and sold them under the imprint of Press of the Sunken Eye to private buyers under the table. One of these copies surfaced when it was being offered in an auction, and it was then discovered that this collection had been lost to the public for decades. Once the authorship was verified, it was readied for true publication. &#34;Life in Provincetown&#34; is a collection of interwoven stories set in one of Nin&#39;s favorite haunts and is populated with bohemian characters who engage in tabooed sexual behavior, all described in Nin&#39;s classic poetic prose. &#34;Marcel&#34; is another set of stories set mostly in Paris and is largely autobiographical, with many of the characters and situations taken directly from Nin&#39;s diaries. It is three times longer than the version in Delta of Venus and contains many lengthy passages, stories even, that were cut and never before published. Auletris is the first new Anais Nin collection of erotica since Little Birds in 1979.</p><p>&#34;Nin scholars and new readers alike have a lot to delight in with this compilation of fiction from one of modern erotica&#39;s most famous founding mothers. Herron&#39;s introduction to the collection deftly places Nin&#39;s career in perspective while explaining the provenance and significance of the two rediscovered stories. The works themselves are delightful. The previously unseen &#34;Life in Provincetown&#34; follows the erotic exploits and histories of the denizens of a small beach town, painting a web of intermingling affairs and encounters, ranging from the voyeuristic to the incestuous. This unedited, lengthier version of the previously published &#34;Marcel&#34; is a gently meandering story about a man who can only find sexual satisfaction if he&#39;s in love, and the adventures of his more experienced partner Mandra. Both tales capture beautiful locales and sensual people with a sympathetic and compelling eye, richly portraying a variety of experiences and scenarios. Readers willing to overlook some outdated language (&#34;She laughed like a negress being tickled&#34;) will find this a welcome and succulent addition to Nin&#39;s formidable legacy.&#34; - Publishers Weekly</p><h2>All the Rage: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Named a "Best Book of 2015" by Bustle, Book Riot, Chicago Public Library, Quill and Quire, and the B&amp;N Teen Blog!</b></p><p>The sheriff's son, Kellan Turner, is not the golden boy everyone thinks he is, and Romy Grey knows that for a fact. Because no one wants to believe a girl from the wrong side of town, the truth about him has cost her everything&#x2015;friends, family, and her community. Branded a liar and bullied relentlessly by a group of kids she used to hang out with, Romy's only refuge is the diner where she works outside of town. No one knows her name or her past there; she can finally be anonymous.

Yet the arrival of white settlers brought the Lakotas into inexorable conflict with the changing world, at a time when their tribe would produce some of the most famous Native Americans in history, including Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, and Crazy Horse. Jeffrey Ostler's powerful history of the Lakotas' struggle captures the heart of a people whose deep relationship with their homeland would compel them to fight for it against overwhelming odds, on battlefields as varied as the Little Bighorn and the chambers of U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Jeffrey Ostler is Beekman Professor of Northwest and Pacific History at the University of Oregon. He is the author of <i>The Plains Sioux and U.S. Colonialism from Lewis and Clark to Wounded Knee</i>.Combining historical and legal threads, Ostler surveys the contest between the U.S. government and the Lakota Indians for title to the Black Hills in South Dakota. Weighing evidence of the Lakotas&#x2019; presence in the Black Hills in the 1700s, Ostler elaborates a more solid historical footing for Lakota claims based on the sacred significance the Black Hills had acquired by the mid-1800 lifetimes of such renowned Lakotas as Sitting Bull. Phasing into treaties culminating in the cession of the Black Hills in 1877, Ostler concisely defines treaty terms or violations that gave legal traction to Lakota litigation. That got going in the 1920s, though slowly: the case wended through the judiciary for 20 years until it was dismissed by the Supreme Court. In 1980, however, the tribunal reversed itself, acknowledging treaty violations and ruling in favor of monetary compensation. Refused by a people wanting the land, not the lucre, the settlement remains in limbo. An evenhanded scholar, Ostler offers a case study that illuminates Native American claims for redress of history. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Psychological Astrology: A Synthesis of Jungian Psychology and Astrology</h2><p>An examination of the traditional wisdom of astrology combined in the light of Jungian psycholgy shows the horoscope to be an accurate picture of the psychic structure and a key to self-knowledge and personal growth. Beginning with a lucid analysis of Jung&#39;s terminology, including the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the theory of synchronicity, Dr. Hamaker-Zondag explores in depth the striking correspondences between Jung&#39;s theory and psychological types and the tradtional elements. She shows how the elements of astrology relate to the psychological types, and discusses the zodiac as a path of life. Psychological Astrology is a must for students since the author elucidates the houses and their structure and provides an enlightening discussion of the planets as they symbolize basic human drives.

The book draws from more than twenty-four months of ethnographic and sociolinguistic fieldwork in a Chicago public school, whose student body is more than 90% Mexican and Puerto Rican, to analyze the racialization of language and its relationship to issues of power and national identity. It focuses specifically on youth socialization to U.S. Latinidad as a contemporary site of political anxiety, raciolinguistic transformation, and urban inequity. <br><br>Jonathan Rosa's account studies the fashioning of Latinidad in Chicago's highly segregated Near Northwest Side; he links public discourse concerning the rising prominence of U.S. Latinidad to the institutional management and experience of raciolinguistic identities there. Anxieties surrounding Latinx identities push administrators to transform "at risk" Mexican and Puerto Rican students into "young Latino professionals." This institutional effort, which requires students to learn to be and, importantly, <em>sound</em> <em>like</em> themselves in highly studied ways, reveals administrators' attempts to navigate a precarious urban terrain in a city grappling with some of the nation's highest youth homicide, dropout, and teen pregnancy rates. Rosa explores the ingenuity of his research participants' responses to these forms of marginalization through the contestation of political, ethnoracial, and linguistic borders.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Rosa</strong> is Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Education, Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, and, by courtesy, Departments of Anthropology and Linguistics, at Stanford University.

It is an essential volume for understanding the co-naturalization of language and race and the key role language plays in the racialization of Latinx youth.

I&#x2019;d accompanied my grandmother to the grocery store&#x2014;that morning, while reading a novel that mentioned hearts of palm, she&#x2019;d been seized by a desire to have some herself and had taken me along on the walk to town&#x2014;and it was in the canned-goods section that we encountered Andrew, who was with his mother. Not being of the same generation, Andrew&#x2019;s mother and my grandmother weren&#x2019;t friends, but they knew each other the way people in Riley, Wisconsin, did. Andrew&#x2019;s mother was the one who approached us, setting her hand against her chest and saying to my grandmother, &#x201c;Mrs. Lindgren, it&#x2019;s Florence Imhof. How are you?&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew and I had been classmates for as long as we&#x2019;d been going to school, but we merely eyed each other without speaking. We both were eight. As the adults chatted, he picked up a can of peas and held it by securing it between his flat palm and his chin, and I wondered if he was showing off. <br><br>This was when my grandmother shoved me a little. &#x201c;Alice, say hello to Mrs. Imhof.&#x201d; As I&#x2019;d been taught, I extended my hand. &#x201c;And isn&#x2019;t your daughter darling,&#x201d; my grandmother continued, gesturing toward Andrew, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t believe I know her name.&#x201d; <br><br>A silence ensued during which I&#x2019;m pretty sure Mrs. Imhof was deciding how to correct my grandmother. At last, touching her son&#x2019;s shoulder, Mrs. Imhof said, &#x201c;This is Andrew. He and Alice are in the same class over at the school.&#x201d; <br><br>My grandmother squinted. &#x201c;Andrew, did you say?&#x201d; She even turned her head, angling her ear as if she were hard of hearing, though I knew she wasn&#x2019;t. She seemed to willfully refuse the pardon Mrs. Imhof had offered, and I wanted to tap my grandmother&#x2019;s arm, to tug her over so her face was next to mine and say, &#x201c;Granny, he&#x2019;s a boy!&#x201d; It had never occurred to me that Andrew looked like a girl&#x2014;little about Andrew Imhof had occurred to me at that time in my life&#x2014;but it was true that he had unusually long eyelashes framing hazel eyes, as well as light brown hair that had gotten a bit shaggy over the summer. However, his hair was long only for that time and for a boy; it was still far shorter than mine, and there was nothing feminine about the chinos or red-and-white-checked shirt he wore. <br><br>&#x201c;Andrew is the younger of our two sons,&#x201d; Mrs. Imhof said, and her voice contained a new briskness, the first hint of irritation. &#x201c;His older brother is Pete.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; My grandmother finally appeared to grasp the situation, but grasping it did not seem to have made her repentant. She leaned forward and nodded at Andrew&#x2014;he still was holding the peas&#x2014;and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. You be sure my granddaughter behaves herself at school. You can report back to me if she doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew had said nothing thus far&#x2014;it was not clear he&#x2019;d been paying enough attention to the conversation to understand that his gender was in dispute&#x2014;but at this he beamed: a closed-mouth but enormous smile, one that I felt implied, erroneously, that I was some sort of mischief-maker and he would indeed be keeping his eye on me. My grandmother, who harbored a lifelong admiration for mischief, smiled back at him like a conspirator. After she and Mrs. Imhof said goodbye to each other (our search for hearts of palm had, to my grandmother&#x2019;s disappointment if not her surprise, proved unsuccessful), we turned in the opposite direction from them. I took my grandmother&#x2019;s hand and whispered to her in what I hoped was a chastening tone, &#x201c;Granny.&#x201d; <br><br>Not in a whisper at all, my grandmother said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that child looks like a girl? He&#x2019;s downright pretty!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not his fault, but I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m the first one to make that mistake. His eyelashes are an inch long.&#x201d; <br><br>As if to verify her claim, we both turned around. By then we were thirty feet from the Imhofs, and Mrs. Imhof had her back to us, leaning toward a shelf. But Andrew was facing my grandmother and me. He still was smiling slightly, and when my eyes met his, he lifted his eyebrows twice. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s flirting with you!&#x201d; my grandmother exclaimed. <br><br>&#x201c;What does &#x2018;flirting&#x2019; mean?&#x201d; <br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s when a person likes you, so they try to catch your attention.&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew Imhof liked me? Surely, if the information had been delivered by an adult&#x2014;and not just any adult but my wily grandmother&#x2014;it had to be true. Andrew liking me seemed neither thrilling nor appalling; mostly, it just seemed unexpected. And then, having considered the idea, I dismissed it. My grandmother knew about some things, but not the social lives of eight-year-olds. After all, she hadn&#x2019;t even recognized Andrew as a boy.<br>In the house I grew up in, we were four: my grandmother, my parents, and me. On my father&#x2019;s side, I was a third-generation only child, which was greatly unusual in those days. While I certainly would have liked a sibling, I knew from an early age not to mention it&#x2014;my mother had miscarried twice by the time I was in first grade, and those were just the pregnancies I knew about, the latter occurring when she was five months along. Though the miscarriages weighted my parents with a quiet sadness, our family as it was seemed evenly balanced. At dinner, we each sat on one side of the rectangular table in the dining room; heading up the sidewalk to church, we could walk in pairs; in the summer, we could split a box of Yummi-Freez ice-cream bars; and we could play euchre or bridge, both of which they taught me when I was ten and which we often enjoyed on Friday and Saturday nights. <br><br>Although my grandmother possessed a rowdy streak, my parents were exceedingly considerate and deferential to each other, and for years I believed this mode to be the norm among families and saw all other dynamics as an aberration. My best friend from early girlhood was Dena Janaszewski, who lived across the street, and I was constantly shocked by what I perceived to be Dena&#x2019;s, and really all the Janaszewskis&#x2019;, crudeness and volume: They hollered to one another from between floors and out windows; they ate off one another&#x2019;s plates at will, and Dena and her two younger sisters constantly grabbed and poked at one another&#x2019;s braids and bottoms; they entered the bathroom when it was occupied; and more shocking than the fact that her father once said <i>goddamn</i> in my presence&#x2014;his exact words, entering the kitchen, were &#x201c;Who took my goddamn hedge clippers?&#x201d;&#x2014;was the fact that neither Dena, her mother, nor her sisters seemed to even notice. <br><br>In my own family, life was calm. My mother and father occasionally disagreed&#x2014;a few times a year he would set his mouth in a firm straight line, or the corners of her eyes would draw down with a kind of wounded disappointment&#x2014;but it happened infrequently, and when it did, it seemed unnecessary to express aloud. Merely sensing discord, whether in the role of inflictor or recipient, pained them enough. <br><br>My father had two mottoes, the first of which was &#x201c;Fools&#x2019; names and fools&#x2019; faces often appear in public places.&#x201d; The second was &#x201c;Whatever you are, be a good one.&#x201d; I never knew the source of the first motto, but the second came from Abraham Lincoln. By profession, my father worked as the branch manager of a bank, but his great passion&#x2014;his hobby, I suppose you&#x2019;d say, which seems to be a thing not many people have anymore unless you count searching the Internet or talking on cell phones&#x2014;was bridges. He especially admired the majesty of the Golden Gate Bridge and once told me that during its construction, the contractor had arranged, at great expense, for an enormous safety net to run beneath it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s called employer responsibility,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t just worried about profit.&#x201d; My father closely followed the building of both the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan&#x2014;he called it the Mighty Mac&#x2014;and later, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which, upon completion in 1964, would connect Brooklyn and Staten Island and be the largest suspension bridge in the world. <br><br>My parents both had grown up in Milwaukee and met in 1943, when my mother was eighteen and working in a glove factory, and my father was twenty and working at a branch of Wisconsin State Bank &amp; Trust. They struck up a conversation in a soda shop, and were engaged by the time my father enlisted in the army. After the war ended, they married and moved forty-five miles west to Riley, my father&#x2019;s mother in tow, so he could open a branch of the bank there. My mother never again held a job. As a housewife, she had a light touch&#x2014;she did not seem overburdened or cranky, she didn&#x2019;t remind the rest of us how much she did&#x2014;and yet she sewed many of her own and my clothes, kept the house meticulous, and always prepared our meals. The food we ate was acceptable more often than delicious; she favored pan-broiled steak, or noodle and cheese loafs, and she taught me her recipes in a low-key, literal way, never explaining why I needed to know them. Why <i>wouldn&#x2019;t</i> I need to know them? She was endlessly patient and a purveyor of small, sweet gestures: Without commenting, she&#x2019;d leave pretty ribbons or peppermint candies on my bed or, on my bureau, a single flower in a three-inch vase. <br><br>My mother was the second youngest of eight siblings, none of whom we saw frequently. She had five brothers and two sisters, and only one of her sisters, my Aunt Marie, who was married to a mechanic and had six children, had ever come to Riley. When my mother&#x2019;s parents were still alive, we&#x2019;d drive to visit them in Milwaukee, but they died within ten days of each other when I was six, and after that we&#x2019;d go years without seeing my aunts, uncles, and cousins. My impression was that their houses all were small and crowded, filled with the squabbling of children and the smell of sour milk, and the men were terse and the women were harried; in a way that was not cruel, none of them appeared to be particularly interested in us. We visited less and less the older I got, and my father&#x2019;s mother never went along, although she&#x2019;d ask us to pick up schnecken from her favorite German bakery. In my childhood, there was a relieved feeling that came over me when we drove away from one of my aunt&#x2019;s or uncle&#x2019;s houses, a feeling I tried to suppress because I knew even then that it was unchristian. Without anyone in my immediate family saying so, I came to understand that my mother had chosen us; she had chosen our life together over one like her siblings&#x2019;, and the fact that she&#x2019;d been able to choose made her lucky. <br><br>Like my mother, my grandmother did not hold a job after the move to Riley, but she didn&#x2019;t really join in the upkeep of the house, either. In retrospect, I&#x2019;m surprised that her unhelpfulness did not elicit resentment from my mother, but it truly seems that it didn&#x2019;t. I think my mother found her mother-in-law entertaining, and in a person who entertains us, there is much we forgive. Most afternoons, when I returned home from school, the two of them were in the kitchen, my mother paused between chores with an apron on or a dust rag over her shoulder, listening intently as my grandmother recounted a magazine article she&#x2019;d just finished about, say, the mysterious murder of a mobster&#x2019;s girlfriend in Chicago. <br><br>My grandmother never vacuumed or swept, and only rarely, if my parents weren&#x2019;t home or my mother was sick, would she cook, preparing dishes notable mostly for their lack of nutrition: An entire dinner could consist of fried cheese or half-raw pancakes. What my grandmother did do was read; this was the primary way she spent her time. It wasn&#x2019;t unusual for her to complete a book a day&#x2014;she preferred novels, especially the Russian masters, but she also read histories, biographies, and pulpy mysteries&#x2014;and for hours and hours every morning and afternoon, she sat either in the living room or on top of her bed (the bed would be made, and she would be fully dressed), turning pages and smoking Pall Malls. From early on, I understood that the household view of my grandmother, which is to say my parents&#x2019; view, was not simply that she was both smart and frivolous but that her smartness and her frivolity were intertwined. That she could tell you all about the curse of the Hope Diamond, or about cannibalism in the Donner Party&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t that she ought to be ashamed, exactly, to possess such knowledge, but there was no reason for her to be proud of it, either. The tidbits she relayed were interesting, but they had little to do with real life: paying a mortgage, scrubbing a pan, keeping warm in the biting cold of Wisconsin winters. <br><br>I&#x2019;m pretty sure that rather than resisting this less than flattering view of herself, my grandmother shared it. In another era, I imagine she&#x2019;d have made an excellent book critic for a newspaper, or even an English professor, but she&#x2019;d never attended college, and neither had my parents. My grandmother&#x2019;s husband, my father&#x2019;s father, had died early, and as a young widow, my grandmother had gone to work in a ladies&#x2019; dress shop, waiting on Milwaukee matrons who, as she told it, had money but not taste. She&#x2019;d held this job until the age of fifty&#x2014;fifty was older then than it is now&#x2014;at which point she&#x2019;d moved to Riley with my newlywed parents. <br><br>My grandmother borrowed the majority of the books she read from the library, but she bought some, too, and these she kept in her bedroom on a shelf so full that every ledge contained two rows; it reminded me of a girl in my class, Pauline Geisseler, whose adult teeth had grown in before her baby teeth fell out and who would sometimes, with a total lack of self-consciousness, open her mouth for us at recess. My grandmother almost never read aloud to me, but she regularly took me to the library&#x2014;I read and reread the Laura Ingalls Wilder books, and both the Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys series&#x2014;and my grandmother often summarized the grown-up books she&#x2019;d read in tantalizing ways: <i>A well-bred married woman falls in love with a man who is not her husband; after her husband learns of the betrayal, she has no choice but to throw herself in the path of an oncoming train . . . </i></p><h2>Historic Cookery</h2><p>When Historic Cookery first appeared in 1931 it may have been the earliest cookbook of New Mexican foods to be published, with heirloom recipes from the author&#39;s own family and others collected from villagers in northern New Mexico.

Many of the recipes were heirlooms from the author&#39;s family and others were collected from villagers in Northern New Mexico. Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert&#39;s cookbook has been credited with the popularization of cooking with chile that led directly to America&#39;s love of native New Mexico foods. In traditional recipes there were no set rules for the preparation of food. The cook was expected to learn the recipes from her relatives. One of the great contributions of Historic Cookery is that for the first tine non-native cook was given exact amounts and measures for the preparation of New Mexican food. The author gives complete recipes for chile sauces, corn dishes, meats, cheese, eggs, and vegetables as well as salads, soups, breads, desserts, and beverages. Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert was born near Las Vegas, New Mexico in 1891.

They appear to portray the seduction of a unicorn, but the story behind their making is unknown&#x2014;until now.<p>Paris, 1490.&nbsp; A shrewd French nobleman commissions six lavish tapestries celebrating his rising status at Court. He hires the charismatic, arrogant, sublimely talented Nicolas des Innocents to design them. Nicolas creates havoc among the women in the house&#x2014;mother and daughter, servant, and lady-in-waiting&#x2014;before taking his designs north to the Brussels workshop where the tapestries are to be woven. There, master weaver Georges de la Chapelle risks everything he has to finish the tapestries&#x2014;his finest, most intricate work&#x2014;on time for his exacting French client. The results change all their lives&#x2014;lives that have been captured in the tapestries, for those who know where to look.</p><p>In <b>The Lady and the Unicorn</b>, Tracy Chevalier weaves fact and fiction into a beautiful, timeless, and intriguing literary tapestry&#x2014;an extraordinary story exquisitely told.</p></p><p>If you think you wouldn't raise your skirts for a rakish legend about the purifying powers of a unicorn's horn, then maybe you aren't a 15th-century serving girl under the sway of a velvet-tongued court painter of ill repute. In keeping with her bestselling <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>, and its Edwardian-era follow-up, <i>Falling Angels</i>, Tracy Chevalier's tale of artistic creation and late-medieval amours, <i>The Lady and the Unicorn</i> is a subtle study in social power, and the conflicts between love and duty. Nicolas des Innocents has been commissioned by the Parisian nobleman Jean Le Viste to design a series of large tapestries for his great hall (in real life, the famous <i>Lady and the Unicorn</i> cycle, now in Paris's Musee National du Moyen-Age Thermes de Cluny). While Nicolas is measuring the walls, he meets a beautiful girl who turns out to be Jean Le Viste's daughter. Their passion is impossible for their world--so forbidden, given their class differences, that its only avenue of expression turns out to be those magnificent tapestries. The historical evidence on which this story is based is slight enough to allow the full play of Chevalier's imagination in this cleverly woven tale. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"I was born and grew up in Washington, DC.

(<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</p><h2>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</h2><p>This luminous story begins in the present day, when a professor invites a colleague to his home to see a painting that he has kept secret for decades. The professor swears it is a Vermeer&#x2014;but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work's inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner's hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives. Susan Vreeland's characters remind us, through their love of this mysterious painting, how beauty transforms and why we reach for it, what lasts and what in our lives is singular and unforgettable.</p><p>There are only 35 known Vermeers extant in the world today. In <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, Susan Vreeland posits the existence of a 36th. The story begins at a private boys' academy in Pennsylvania where, in the wake of a faculty member's unexpected death, math teacher Cornelius Engelbrecht makes a surprising revelation to one of his colleagues. He has, he claims, an authentic Vermeer painting, "a most extraordinary painting in which a young girl wearing a short blue smock over a rust-colored skirt sat in profile at a table by an open window." His colleague, an art teacher, is skeptical and though the technique and subject matter are persuasively Vermeer-like, Engelbrecht can offer no hard evidence--no appraisal, no papers--to support his claim. He says only that his father, "who always had a quick eye for fine art, picked it up, let us say, at an advantageous moment." Eventually it is revealed that Engelbrecht's father was a Nazi in charge of rounding up Dutch Jews for deportation and that the picture was looted from one doomed family's home: <blockquote> That's when I saw that painting, behind his head. All blues and yellows and reddish brown, as translucent as lacquer. It had to be a Dutch master. Just then a private found a little kid covered with tablecloths behind some dishes in a sideboard cabinet. We'd almost missed him. </blockquote> By the end of "Love Enough," this first of eight interrelated stories tracing the history of "Girl in Hyacinth Blue," the painting's fate at the hands of guilt-riddled Engelbrecht <i>fils</i> is in question. Unfortunately, there is no doubt about the probable destiny of the previous owners, the Vredenburg family of Rotterdam, who take center stage in the powerful "A Night Different From All Other Nights." Vreeland handles this tale with subtlety and restraint, setting it at Passover, the year before the looting, and choosing to focus on the adolescent Hannah Vredenburg's difficult passage into adulthood in the face of an uncertain future. In the next story, "Adagia," she moves even further into the past to sketch "how love builds itself unconsciously ... out of the momentous ordinary" in a tender portrait of a longtime marriage. Back and back Vreeland goes, back through other owners, other histories, to the very inception of the painting in the homely, everyday objects of the Vermeer household--a daughter's glass of milk, a son's shirt in need of buttons, a wife's beloved sewing basket--"the unacknowledged acts of women to hallow home." <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i> ends with the painting's subject herself, Vermeer's daughter Magdalena, who first sends the portrait out into the world as payment for a family debt, then sees it again, years later at an auction. <blockquote> She thought of all the people in all the paintings she had seen that day, not just Father's, in all the paintings of the world, in fact. Their eyes, the particular turn of a head, their loneliness or suffering or grief was borrowed by an artist to be seen by other people throughout the years who would never see them face to face. People who would be that close to her, she thought, a matter of a few arms' lengths, looking, looking, and they would never know her. </blockquote> In this final passage, Susan Vreeland might be describing her own masterpiece as well as Vermeer's. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>That a thing made by hand, the work and thought of a single individual, can endure much longer than its maker, through centuries in fact, has always filled me with wonder. Sometimes in museums, looking at a humble piece of pottery from ancient Persia or Pompeii, or a finely wrought medieval manuscript toiled over by a nameless monk, or a primitive tool with a humorously carved handle, I am moved to tears. The unknown life of its maker is so brief, but the work of his or her hands and heart remains. <p>The territory for this book is The Netherlands, as well as the spiritual territory of my love for painting and for lives lived in other eras. I bear a Dutch name, and there's a small town in North Holland named Vreeland. More than that I did not have, but I could read, and thus could imagine my way into a heritage and feel some sense of personal origins in the world. Combining these elements, much like a painter designs a composition, resulted in Girl in Hyacinth Blue.</p></p><h2>Toil &amp; Trouble: A Memoir</h2><p><p><b>From the number one <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author comes another stunning memoir that is tender, touching...and just a little spooky. </b></p><p>"Here&#x2019;s a partial list of things I don&#x2019;t believe in: God. The Devil. Heaven. Hell. Bigfoot. Ancient Aliens. Past lives. Life after death. Vampires. Zombies. Reiki. Homeopathy. Rolfing. Reflexology. Note that 'witches' and 'witchcraft' are absent from this list. The thing is, I wouldn&#x2019;t believe in them, and I would privately ridicule any idiot who did, except for one thing: I <i>am</i> a witch." </p><p> For as long as Augusten Burroughs could remember, he knew things he shouldn't have known. He manifested things that shouldn't have come to pass. And he told exactly no one about this, save one person: his mother. His mother reassured him that it was all perfectly normal, that he was descended from a long line of witches, going back to the days of the early American colonies. And that this family tree was filled with witches. It was a bond that he and his mother shared--until the day she left him in the care of her psychiatrist to be raised in his family (but that's a whole other story). After that, Augusten was on his own. On his own to navigate the world of this tricky power; on his own to either use or misuse this gift. </p><p>From the hilarious to the terrifying, <i>Toil &amp; Trouble</i> is a chronicle of one man's journey to understand himself, to reconcile the powers he can wield with things with which he is helpless.

Kennedy&#x2019;s death and the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson as president in 1963. Attorney Barr McClellan, a former member of L.B.J.&#x2019;s legal team, uses hundreds of newly released documents, including insider interviews, court papers, and the Warren Commission, to illuminate the maneuvers, payoffs, and power plays that revolved around the assassination of Kennedy and to expose L.B.J.&#x2019;s involvement in the murder plot.<br><br> In addition to revealing new information, McClellan answers common questions surrounding the assassination of our thirty-fifth president. Who had the opportunity, motive, and means to assassinate J.F.K.? Who controlled the investigation and findings of the Warren Commission? This historically significant book is proof that absolute power, money, blood, corruption, and deception were at the heart of politics in the early 1960s, and it represents the very best investigative journalism has to offer.</p><p><b>Barr McClellan</b> represented President Lyndon B. Johnson and his interests from 1966 through 1971. He served primarily through Texas power attorney Edward Clark and Johnson&#x2019;s business attorney Don Thomas, advising them and Johnson on political strategy, campaign contributions, attorney-client privilege issues, television matters, and labor disputes. He lives in Gulfport, Mississippi.McClellan's overwrought conspiracy theory claims that Lyndon Johnson-motivated by power lust, fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket, and the need to cover up various scandals-masterminded Kennedy's assassination with the help of his evil "superlawyer" Ed Clark. But his evidence is meager and murky, even by the standards of Kennedy conspiracy scholarship. The main exhibit is a smudged partial fingerprint from Oswald's sniper's nest that may or may not belong to a Johnson associate, depending on which fingerprint expert you ask. Otherwise McClellan relies on what he heard during his years at Clark's law firm-e.g., a partner told him that Clark arranged the assassination-and the description of scenes in which a "a fixed stare," vague, unspoken understandings, and "code words" proved that Johnson and Clark were conspiring. Sample accusations include: "I knew Clark was admitting to the payoff for the assassination even though he never said he received a payoff for assassinating Kennedy...." The book offers many detailed accounts of conspiratorial meetings that turn out to be not fact but "faction" or "journalistic novelization"-that is, conjecture designed to distract readers from the lack of evidence. McClellan styles the assassination as the defeat of Camelot by Texas's sleazy nexus of dirty politicians, slick lawyers and oil money; the unmasking of Johnson, the personification of such back-room power politics, therefore promises a public "emotional purging" leading to the renewal of democracy. His confusingly structured, evasively argued, often nonsensical theories attest to the crime's continuing potency as a symbol of America's mythic heart of darkness.

An unnamed narrator, a writer in Vienna, is torn between two men: viewed, through the tilting prism of obsession, she travels further into her own madness, anxiety, and genius.&nbsp;<em>Malina&nbsp;</em>explores love, "deathstyles," the roots of fascism, and passion.<br></p><p><p>&nbsp;(1926&#x2013;1973) is widely regarded as one of the greatest German-language writers of the twentieth century.

Dense, compelling, often weirdly funny, a dark fairy tale told as a murder mystery. Rewarding and highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It seems in <em>Malina</em> there is nothing Bachmann cannot do with words.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In place of Wittgenstein&#x2019;s language as city, <em>Malina</em> creates a vision of Vienna as language, one might even say as mind: to what extent it may be feminine, masculine, or otherwise is impossible to discern.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jessie Ferguson, <em>Music &amp; Literature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Enigmatic, yet piercing: equal to the best of Virginia Woolf and Samuel Beckett.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A&nbsp;psychological thriller of a tormented, existential sort. And it&#x2019;s a love triangle, though a triangle most accurately drawn with dotted lines, given that it&#x2019;s debatable how many of its members are real....This revised translation appears at a time when the book feels quite contemporary. Though even innovative mainstream fiction now being published reads like &#x201c;A Is for Apple&#x201d; compared to <em>Malina</em>, there&#x2019;s no question that the book shares a spirit with any and all books about the unsought psychological challenges of being a woman in this world.&nbsp;Lucid and powerful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Williams, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A masterpiece!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Naja Marie Aidt, <em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bachmann&#x2019;s vision is so original that the effect is like having a new letter of the alphabet.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the astonishing desolation and wonder that is Ingeborg Bachmann&#x2019;s <em>Malina</em>... there is no certain narrative, but there are many, deeply internalised, stories.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicci Gerard, <em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Although Bachmann imbibed the despondent charm of her forebears, her only finished novel reaches the contemporary reader as something strange and sui generis: an existential portrait, a work of desperate obsession, a proto-feminist classic, and one of the most jagged renderings of female consciousness European literature has produced. In its torrent of language, paralyzing lassitude, and relentless constriction of expectation and escape, <em>Malina</em> condenses&#x2015;and then detonates&#x2015;the neurasthenic legacy of the interwar Austrian novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dustin Illingworth, <em>The Nation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An existential portrait, a work of desperate obsession, a proto-feminist classic, and one of the most jagged renderings of female consciousness European literature has produced.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dustin Illingworth, <em>The Nation</em></strong></p><h2>The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest</h2><p>Truth is stranger than fiction. And nowhere in literature is it so apparent as in this classic work, <i>The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest</i>. This autobiography of a Jesuit priest in Elizabethan England is a most remarkable document and John Gerard, its author, a most remarkable priest in a time when to be a Catholic in England courted imprisonment and torture; to be a priest was treason by act of Parliament.Smuggled into England after his ordination and dumped on a Norfolk beach at night, Fr. Gerard disguised himself as a country gentleman and traveled about the country saying Mass, preaching and ministering to the faithful in secret - always in constant danger. The houses in which he found shelter were frequently raided by priest hunters; priest-holes, hide-outs and hair-breadth escapes were part of his daily life. He was finally caught and imprisoned, and later removed to the infamous Tower of London where he was brutally tortured.The stirring account of his escape, by means of a rope thrown across the moat, is a daring and magnificent climax to a true story which, for sheer narrative power and interest, far exceeds any fiction. Here is an accurate and compelling picture of England when Catholics were denied their freedom to worship and endured vicious persecution and often martyrdom. But more than the story of a single priest, <i>The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest</i> epitomizes the constant struggle of all human beings through the ages to maintain their freedom. It is a book of courage and of conviction whose message is most timely for our age.</p><p>John Gerard, S.J., was a Jesuit missionary priest in Elizabethan England when the Catholic Church was under heavy persecution by the government. The footnotes provided by the translator prove the absolute facts of his account in this book, which is corroborated even by the files of the Elizabethan secret police.</p><h2>Colored People: A Memoir</h2><p>In a coming-of-age story as enchantingly vivid and ribald as anything Mark Twain or Zora Neale Hurston, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., recounts his childhood in the mill town of Piedmont, West Virginia, in the 1950s and 1960s and ushers readers into a gossip, of lye-and-mashed-potato &#x201c;processes,&#x201d; and of slyly stubborn resistance to the indignities of segregation.<br> &nbsp;<br> A winner of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>&#x2019;s Heartland Award and the Lillian Smith Prize, <i>Colored People</i> is a pungent and poignant masterpiece of recollection, a work that extends and deepens our sense of African American history even as it entrances us with its bravura storytelling</p><p>"Affecting, beautifully written and morally complex...The heart of the memoir is Gates' portrait of his family, and its placement in a black society whose strength, richness and self-confidence thrived in the darkness of segregation."--Richard Eder, The Los Angeles Times<br><br> "[Colored People] may well become a classic of American memoir."--The Boston Globe<br>From an American Book Award-winning author comes a pungent and poignant masterpiece of recollection that ushers readers into a now-vanished &#34;colored&#34; world and extends and deepens our sense of African-American history, even as it entrances us with its bravura storytelling.</p><h2>The Heart&#39;s Code: Tapping the Wisdom and Power of Our Heart Energy</h2><p>A fascinating synthesis of ancient wisdom, modern medicine, scientific research, and personal experiences that proves that the human heart, not the brain, holds the secrets that link body, mind, and spirit.<br><br>You know that the heart loves and feels, but did you know that the heart also thinks, remembers, communicates with other hearts, helps regulate immunity, and contains stored information that continually pulses through your body?

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

They had been part of her all of her life, and for most of her life she&#x2019;d learned to block it out, push it all away.</p><p>But these wouldn&#x2019;t relent, no matter how she pitted her will against them. Dreams of blood and battle; of strange, moonstruck lands. In them, the faces and voices of people unknown but somehow vitally familiar lived with her. The woman with the fierce and canny eyes of a wolf, the man with the silver sword. They roamed her dreams with a woman who rose from the sea laughing, the man with the golden compass.</p><p>And through all of them, strongly, the dark-haired man who held lightning in his hands.</p><p>Who were they? How did she&#x2014;or would she&#x2014;know them? Why did she feel such a strong need for them, all of them?</p><p>With them walked death and pain&#x2014;she knew&#x2014;and yet with them came the chance for true joy, true self. True love.</p><p>She believed in true love&#x2014;for others. She&#x2019;d never sought it for herself, as love demanded so much, brought such chaos into a life. So much feeling.</p><p>She wanted, had always wanted, the quiet and settled, and believed she&#x2019;d found it in her little house in the mountains of North Carolina.</p><p>There she had the solitude she&#x2019;d sought. There she could spend her days painting, or in her garden without interference or interruption. Her needs were few; her work provided enough income to meet them.</p><p>Now her dreams were haunted by five people who called her by name. Why couldn&#x2019;t she find theirs?</p><p>She sketched her dreams&#x2014;the faces, the seas and hills and ruins. Caves and gardens, storms and sunsets. Over the long winter she filled her workboard with the sketches, and began to pin them to her walls.</p><p>She painted the man with lightning in his hands, spending days perfecting every detail, the exact shade and shape of his eyes&#x2014;deep and dark and hooded&#x2014;the thin white scar, like a lightning bolt, scoring his left eyebrow.</p><p>He stood on a cliff, high above a boiling sea. Wind streamed through his dark hair. She could all but feel it, like hot breath. And he was fearless in the face of the storm as death flew toward him.</p><p>Somehow she stood with him, just as fearless.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t sleep until she&#x2019;d finished it, wept when she did. She feared she&#x2019;d lost her mind, and visions were all she had left. For days she left the painting on the easel while he watched her work or clean or sleep.</p><p>Or dream.</p><p>She told herself she&#x2019;d pack it for shipping, send it to her agent for sale. And dipping her brush, she signed it at last.</p><p>Sasha Riggs&#x2014;her name on the verge of the storm-wrecked sea.</p><p>But she didn&#x2019;t pack it for shipping. She packed others instead, the work of the long winter, arranged for transport.</p><p>Exhausted, she gave in, curled on the couch in the attic she&#x2019;d converted to her studio, and let the dreams take her.</p><p>The storm raged. Wind whipping, the sea crashing, jagged spears of lighting hurled from the sky like flaming bolts from a bow. The rain swept in from the sea toward the cliff in a thick curtain.</p><p>But he stood, watching it. And held out his hand for hers.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand this, any of this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do, you more than most.&#x201d; When he brought her hand to his lips she felt love simply saturate her. &#x201c;Who hides from themselves, Sasha, as you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I only want peace. I want the quiet. I don&#x2019;t want storms, and battles. I don&#x2019;t want you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lies.&#x201d; His lips curved as he brought her hand to them again. &#x201c;You know you&#x2019;re lying to me, to yourself. How much longer will you refuse to live as you were meant to? To love as you were born to?&#x201d;</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands, and the ground shook under her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Face it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See it. We can&#x2019;t begin without you. We can&#x2019;t end it until we begin. Find me, Sasha. Come find me.&#x201d;</p><p>He pulled her in, took her lips with his. As he did, the storm broke over them with mad fury.</p><p>This time, she embraced it.</p><p>She woke, tired still, pushed herself up, pressed her fingers to her shadowed eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Find me,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Where? I wouldn&#x2019;t know where to start looking if I wanted to.&#x201d; Her fingers trailed down to her lips, and she swore she still felt the pressure of his.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough. It&#x2019;s all enough now.&#x201d;</p><p>She rose quickly, began to pull the sketches from the walls, the board, letting them fall to the floor. She&#x2019;d take them out, throw them out. Burn them. Get them out of her house, out of her head.</p><p>She&#x2019;d get out herself, take a trip somewhere, anywhere. It had been years since she&#x2019;d gone anywhere. Somewhere warm, she told herself as she frantically yanked down her dreams. A beach somewhere.</p><p>She could hear her own breath heaving, see her own fingers trembling. Near to breaking she lowered to the floor amid the sketches, a woman too thin with the weight the dreams had stolen, her long blond hair bundled up into its habitual messy bun. Shadows plagued her eyes of a clear and crystal blue.</p><p>She looked down at her hands. There was talent there. She always had been, always would be, grateful for that gift. But she carried other gifts, not so gratefully.</p><p>In the dream, he&#x2019;d asked her to see. Nearly all her life she&#x2019;d done all she could to block the sight she&#x2019;d been born with.</p><p>Yes, to hide from herself, just as he&#x2019;d said.</p><p>If she opened to it, accepted it, there would be pain and sorrow. And the knowledge of what might be.</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>She&#x2019;d clean up&#x2014;give herself time. She&#x2019;d pick up all the sketches and file them away. She wouldn&#x2019;t burn them, of course she wouldn&#x2019;t burn them. That had been fear talking.</p><p>She&#x2019;d file them, and take a trip. Get away from home for a week or two, let herself think and decide.</p><p>On her hands and knees, she began to gather the sketches, organizing them in her way. The woman with the fierce eyes, the man with the sword, sketches of her dream people together.</p><p>Seascapes and landscapes, a palace shining on a hill, a circle of stones.</p><p>She laid one of the dozens of the man she&#x2019;d just dreamed of on a pile, reached for another.</p><p>And knew.</p><p>She&#x2019;d drawn the sickle-shaped island from various viewpoints, and this one showed its high cliffs, its undulating hills thick with trees. Showed it floating in the sea, washed with sunlight. Buildings jumbled together to form a city in the foreground, and the stretch of land, speared with mountains spread in the distance.</p><p>The pencil sketch took on color and life as she studied it. So much green, a thousand shades of it from dusky to emerald. So much blue, deep and rich or frothing with waves surrounding it. She saw boats sailing, figures diving off seawalls to swim and splash.</p><p>And she saw the promontory where she&#x2019;d stood with him as the storm flew in.</p><p>&#x201c;All right then, I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d; Was she giving in, she wondered, or standing up? But she&#x2019;d go, she&#x2019;d look.</p><p>It would either end the dreams, or bring them to life as the sketch came to life in her hands.</p><p>She went over to her little desk, opened her laptop. And booked a flight to Corfu.</p><p>Giving herself only two days to pack, arrange details, close up the house meant she couldn&#x2019;t change her mind. She slept on the plane, dreamlessly, grateful for the respite. And still the cab ride from the airport to the hotel she&#x2019;d chosen near Old Town was a blur. Disoriented, she checked in, struggling to remember to smile, to exchange the expected small talk with the front desk, with the cheerful bellman with the cheerful eyes and thick accent as they rode the narrow elevator to her room.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t asked for a particular floor or a view. It was enough she&#x2019;d taken this step, wherever it would lead her. But she wasn&#x2019;t surprised, not at all surprised, when steps into the room she barely noticed, she faced the windows, the blue sea, and the spread of the sand she knew so well.</p><p>She smiled away the bellman&#x2019;s offer to fetch her ice, or anything she might wish. She only wanted solitude again. The airports, the plane, so many people. They crowded her still.</p><p>Alone, she walked to the window, opened it to cool spring air that smelled of the sea and flowers, and studied the scene she&#x2019;d sketched weeks before, and carried with others in a portfolio in her suitcase.</p><p>She felt nothing, not now, but the fogginess of jet lag and travel fatigue. And some wonder that she&#x2019;d actually traveled so far on impulse.</p><p>Turning away, she unpacked to give herself some sense of place and order. Then just lay down on the bed and dropped into sleep again.</p><p>Lightning and storms, the beat of the sun, the beat of the sea. Three stars so bright and brilliant her eyes stung. When they shot away from the curve of the moon, fell in streams of light, the world trembled from the strikes of power.</p><p>Blood and battle, fear and flight. Climbing high, diving deep.</p><p>Her dream lover taking her mouth, taking her body, making her ache with feelings. So much. Too much. Never enough. Her own laughter, barely recognized, sprung from joy. Tears shed, flooding from grief.</p><p>And in the darkness, a light burned through. In the darkness she held fire in her hand. As she held it up, for all to see, the earth quaked, rocks tumbled. What was fury flew at her with claws and teeth.</p><p>For God&#x2019;s sake, Sasha, wake up! Get your ass moving.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; She woke with a start, the voice still echoing inside her head, her heart still thumping with fear.</p><p>Just another dream, she told herself, just one more to add to her collection.</p><p>The light had softened, and lay now like silk over the water. She had no idea how long she&#x2019;d slept, but the dream voice had something right. It was time to wake up.</p><p>She showered off the travel, changed into fresh clothes. Since she wasn&#x2019;t working, she left her hair down. She ordered herself out of the room. She&#x2019;d go down, sit on the terrace, have a drink. She&#x2019;d come, given up her quiet and alone, and come.</p><p>Now something or someone needed to come to her.</p><p>She found her way out, strolled under a pergola thickly twined with wisteria already starting to bloom. Its scent followed her as she turned away from the pool, the canvas sling chairs lined up around its skirt toward a stone terrace. Clay pots gloriously crowded with flowers of hot reds and purples glowed as the sun wheeled west. The fronds of palm trees hung still.</p><p>Tables under shading umbrellas&#x2014;all in bright white&#x2014;scattered over the stone. She noted only a few were occupied, and was grateful. Not solitude perhaps, but quiet. She thought to take one a bit apart from the others, started to angle away.</p><p>The woman also sat a bit apart. Her short, sun-streaked brown hair had long bangs that swept down to the amber lenses of her sunglasses. She sat back, her bright orange Chucks propped on the other chair of her table for two as she sipped something frothy out of a champagne flute.</p><p>The light shimmered for a moment, and Sasha&#x2019;s heart stuttered with it. She knew she stared, and couldn&#x2019;t stop. And understood why when the woman tipped down her sunglasses, and stared back over them.</p><p>The eyes of a wolf, tawny and fierce.</p><p>Sasha fought back the urge to simply turn around, go back to her room where it was safe. Instead she mentally shoved herself forward and walked over while those golden eyes appraised her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she began.</p><p>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I . . . Do you know me?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman raised her eyebrows under the long bangs. &#x201c;Are you somebody I should know?&#x201d;</p><p>I know your face, Sasha thought. I&#x2019;ve seen it countless times.</p><p>&#x201c;Could I sit down?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman angled her head, continued her cool, unblinking study. Carelessly she slid her feet off the chair. &#x201c;Sure, but if you&#x2019;re thinking about hitting on me, except for a one-nighter in college, I stick with men.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not that.&#x201d; Sasha sat, tried to find her bearings. Before she could, a waiter in a white jacket stopped by the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Kalispera. Could I bring you a drink, miss?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, actually, yes. Ah, what are you drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman lifted her glass. &#x201c;Peach Bellini.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds just right. Would you like another? I&#x2019;ll buy you a drink.&#x201d;</p><p>Under her thick sweep of bangs, the woman&#x2019;s eyebrows lifted. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two then, thanks. I&#x2019;m Sasha,&#x201d; she said when he left to fill the order. &#x201c;Sasha Riggs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Riley Gwin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Riley.&#x201d; A name, she thought, to go with the face. &#x201c;I know how this is going to sound, but . . . I&#x2019;ve dreamed about you.&#x201d;</p><p>Riley took another sip, smiled. &#x201c;It sounds like you&#x2019;re hitting on me. And you&#x2019;re really pretty, Sasha, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, I mean literally. I recognized you because I&#x2019;ve dreamed about you, for months now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. What was I doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t expect you to believe me. But the dreams are why I&#x2019;m here, in Corfu. I don&#x2019;t&#x2014; Wait.&#x201d; The sketches, she thought, and pushed to her feet.</p><p>A picture was worth a thousand, after all.</p><p>&#x201c;I want to show you something. Will you wait until I come back?&#x201d;</p><p>Riley only shrugged, lifted her glass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got another drink coming, so I&#x2019;ll be here for a while yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; Sasha promised, and hurried away.</p><p>Sipping her drink, Riley considered. She knew all about dreams, and wouldn&#x2019;t discount them out of hand. She&#x2019;d seen and experienced far too much in her life to discount anything out of hand.</p><p>And this Sasha Riggs struck her as sincere. Nervy, wound tight, but sincere. Still, she had her own reasons for being in Corfu, and they didn&#x2019;t include starring in someone else&#x2019;s dreams.</p><p>The waiter came back with a tray, set the drinks, a bowl of fat olives, another of fancy nuts on the table. &#x201c;The other lady?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;She forgot something. She&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; Riley handed him her empty glass. &#x201c;Efkharisto.&#x201d;</p><p>She tried an almond, went back to contemplating the sea, glanced back again when she heard the hurried footsteps&#x2014;wedged sandals on stone.</p><p>Sasha sat again, holding a leather portfolio. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an artist,&#x201d; she began.</p><p>"Congratulations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had these dreams all winter. They started right after the first of the year. Every night.&#x201d; Waking dreams, too, but she wasn&#x2019;t ready to share that much. &#x201c;I sketched the people, the places in them, the ones that kept reoccurring.&#x201d;</p><p>She opened the portfolio, chose the sketch that had brought her to where she sat. &#x201c;I drew this weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>Riley took the sketch, lips pursing as she studied it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re good, and yeah, this is Corfu.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this is you.&#x201d;</p><p>Sasha laid down a sketch, full body, of Riley. She wore cargo pants, hiking boots, a battered leather jacket, a wide-brimmed hat. Her hand rested on the butt of the knife sheathed at her belt.</p><p>As Riley lifted the sketch, Sasha set down another. &#x201c;So is this.&#x201d; A head-and-shoulders sketch this time, of Riley looking straight ahead with a curled-lip smile.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; Riley muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, and need to find out. I thought I was losing my mind. But you&#x2019;re real, and you&#x2019;re here. Like me. I don&#x2019;t know about the others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What others?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are six of us, including me.&#x201d; Sasha dug into the portfolio again. &#x201c;Working together, traveling together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I work ...</p></p><h2>Lost City (The NUMA Files)</h2><p><b>The NUMA crew, under Kurt Austin&#x2019;s direction, take on a blood-thirsty family with a fortune built on crime, in what may be race to discover the very secret of ever-lasting life in this heart-bounding installment in the #1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling series.<br></b><br> Kurt Austin is mid-mission when his new colleague, the stunning archeologist Skye Labelle, is called away to examine a mysterious 16th-century military helmet discovered in the possession of a very contemporary-looking corpse.

Suddenly, to Miss Julia's delight, a wedding is in the offing: Handsome Deputy Coleman Bates and attorney Binkie Enloe announce their plans to run down to the courthouse and tie the knot. But Miss Julia insists they have a real wedding ceremony and vows to make it happen. When a missing preacher, a crowd of uninvited guests, and a queasy bride threaten the happy event, Miss Julia is there to restore order, confirming her undying motto: if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself!</p><p>If you've ever lived in a small town or been active in a church, chances are you know a Miss Julia, the paragon of outdated correctness at the center of Ann B. Ross's series of comic novels. One-third busybody, one-third Southern relic, and one-third loving kindness, the elderly Miss Julia finds herself at a loss at the beginning of <i>Miss Julia Throws a Wedding</i>. Although her own marriage was about as uplifting as a burned pot roast, she is mortified to learn that Hazel Marie, her dead husband's mistress, proposes to move out of Miss Julia's house and into a life of sin with the perpetual bachelor J.D. Pickens. At least Deputy Sheriff Coleman Bates and attorney Binkie Enloe, longtime lovers, have finally decided to do the right thing. Now if only they would do it the right way. Intent on preserving the niceties, Miss Julia takes over the wedding for Coleman and Binkie, vetoing their plans for a quick courthouse union and struggling to pull together a tasteful formal event with one week's notice. To complicate matters, a neighborhood thief and troublemaker, Dixon Hightower, has escaped from police custody. With only her imperious nature and the force of her convictions, can Miss Julia create the wedding of her dreams for Binkie and Coleman? It's a thin but spirited romp, like a village cozy without the unpleasantness of a murder. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p><b><b>Ann B.

His Merde novels have been bestsellers all over the world, including France. His non-fiction books include Talk to the Snail, an insider&#39;s guide to understanding the French; How the French Won Waterloo (or Think They Did), an amused look at France&#39;s continuing obsession with Napoleon; Dirty Bertie: An English King Made in France, a biography of Edward VII; and 1000 Years of Annoying the French, which was a number one bestseller in Britain.

Rather than offering a general overview of the Gospel women or focusing on a single theme, Richard Bauckham studies in great depth both the individual women who appear in the Gospels and the specific passages in which they appear. <br><br>This unique approach reveals that there is much more to be known about such women than previous studies have assumed. Employing historical and literary readings of the biblical texts, Bauckham successfully captures the particularity of each woman he studies. <br><br>An opening look at the Old Testament book of Ruth introduces the possibilities of reading Scripture from a woman's perspective. Other studies examine the women found in Matthew's genealogies, the prophet Anna, Mary of Clopas, Joanna, Salome, and the women featured in the Gospel resurrection narrative. A number of these women have never been the subject of deep theological enquiry.<br><br>Unlike most recent books, Bauckham's work is not dominated by a feminist agenda. It does not presume in advance that the Gospel texts support patriarchal oppression, but it does venture some of the new and surprising possibilities that arise when the texts are read from the perspective of their female characters.<br><br>Astute, sensitive to issues of gender, and written by one of today's leading theologians, <i>Gospel Women</i> will be of interest to a wide range of readers.</p><p>Richard Bauckham is professor emeritus of New Testament studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, and senior scholar at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. A fellow of both the British Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he has also written <em>Bibl</em><b>Concordia Journal</b><br> "Richard Bauckham . . . has produced an unusual book in which his great learning is clearly on display. Not only is Bauckham very well versed in the New Testament, but he demonstrates an encyclopedic knowledge of both early Judaism and early Christianity. . . Heartily recommended to all serious students of the Gospels."<br><br><b>Catholic Library World</b><br> "As always in his writing, Richard Bauckham is thorough and meticulous with this comprehensive survey of the named women in the gospel tradition."<br><br><b>Tal Ilan</b><br> "This book is an interesting combination of theology, feminist thinking, and history. Richard Bauckham's erudition in the ancient Christian sources within the New Testament and without is impressive. His use of information derived from completely different disciplines as far afield as epigraphy and Targum is instructive and enlightening. This is not just another book on New Testament women. It is essential to all who are interested in women, history, ancient Judaism, and ancient Christianity."<br><br><b>Marianne Meye Thompson</b><br> "The texts that deal with women in the New Testament have been worked over so often it might seem that there is nothing left to say. In this masterful study Richard Bauckham easily proves this is not the case. Bauckham's acquaintance with feminist criticism and other approaches to these texts, his careful attention to the details of the narratives, and his fresh historical research bring an unparalleled depth to his work. Not only does he establish a benchmark for future interpretation, but he also models how close and careful study of a Gospel can illumine the whole. Those who would dismiss this book as 'just another work on women in the New Testament' will deprive themselves of the feast offered here."<br><br><b>Ben Witherington III</b><br> "Richard Bauckham is well known for his encyclopedic knowledge of early Judaism and its offshoot, early Jewish Christianity. Here he applies that depth of knowledge to a specific important subject ? the named women in the Gospels. The results are not only illuminating but exciting. This is an invaluable resource on the subject. Highly recommended!"<br><br><b>Religious Studies Review</b><br> "This is an outstanding volume that reflects the author's careful research and penchant for presenting essentials in language fit even for beginners."<br><br><b>Library Journal</b><br> "Bauckham has written an outstanding scholarly study of the women of the Christian Scriptures. . . At times, his speculations and findings, as in the substantial middle section on the Apostle Joanna, are nothing less than astonishing.

No longer do patients have to accept that their infertility is "just bad luck" and they just have to "keep on trying." No longer should women with recurrent miscarriages have to listen to their doctor telling them that their loss was "God's will" or that they ought to be thankful because their baby was probably chromosomally abnormal. The statistics simply do not support such claims&#x2014;in fact, they show that repeated reproductive failure can be a symptom of wider health problems in the mother. Furthermore, the root cause can be treated&#x2014;not only to promote the chances of a successful pregnancy, but to improve the mother's health long-term.In response to growing demand, the thoughts and theories of the internationally acclaimed fertility specialist Dr. Alan Beer have been documented. "Is Your Body Baby-Friendly?" explains for the first time ever why "unexplained" infertility, IVF failures and recurrent miscarriages happen. <p>This book shows how the immune system can behave in a way that prevents a pregnancy from continuing. High levels of Natural Killer cells, genetic compatibility between partners and blood clotting problems are all significant causes of reproductive failure. </p><p>Autoimmunity&#x2014;either inherited or environmentally triggered&#x2014;is a major reason for the increase in infertility and miscarriage today.

Air peppered with swirling, stinging blades of snow whirled high above Coldarra. Other beings would shiver and shield their eyes, fluff their fur or feathers, or wrap themselves more tightly in their cloaks. The great blue dragon whose wings beat a slow rhythm paid no heed to such things as snow or cold. He had taken to the air in search of the crisp bite of the frigid, snow-speckled wind, hoping, perhaps futilely, that it would cleanse his thoughts and soothe his spirit. </p><p>Kalecgos, though young as dragons reckoned age, had already borne witness to tremendous change among his people. The blue dragons had endured so very much, it seemed to him. They had twice lost their beloved Aspect, Malygos&#x2014;once to insanity for millennia, and then finally to death. Ironically, and poignantly, the blues&#x2014;the intellectuals and the guardians of arcane magic in the world of Azeroth&#x2014;were the flight most drawn to order and calmness, and the least able to deal with such chaos. </p><p>Yet even in the midst of this upheaval, their hearts had stayed true. The spirit of the blue dragonflight had chosen not the hard-line path represented by Malygos&#x2019;s deceased blood heir, Arygos, but the gentler, more joyful way offered to them by Kalecgos. And that choice had proved to be the right one. Arygos had in actuality been betraying the flight, not striving to be a devoted caretaker. He had promised to deliver his people to the evil&#x2014;and quite insane&#x2014;dragon Deathwing, once they had sworn to follow Arygos. Instead, the blues had joined with the reds, greens, and bronzes&#x2014;and one unique orc&#x2014;to help bring down that great monster. </p><p>But as Kalecgos flew across the darkening sky, the snow below turning lavender, he knew that with that victory, the flights, in a way, had also sacrificed themselves. The Aspects were no more, though the dragons who had once been Aspects lived on. The defeat of Deathwing had demanded all they could give, and at the end of that battle, though Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, Ysera, and Kalecgos still survived, their Aspect abilities were gone&#x2014;poured into the final moment of the struggle. The Aspects had been made for this single act. With it accomplished, they had fulfilled their destinies. </p><p>There was a less direct effect as well. The flights had always had a surety about their roles, a firm understanding of their purpose. But now that the moment for which they had been created had come&#x2014;and gone&#x2014;what purpose was left to them? Many blues had already departed. Some had sought his blessing before leaving the Nexus&#x2014;Kalecgos continued to be their leader, although the powers of an Aspect were no longer his. They had told him that they were restless and wished to see if there was some other place in the world where their skills and abilities would be appreciated. The rest had simply gone&#x2014;present one day, vanished the next. Those who remained were either becoming increasingly agitated or surrendering to a bleak sense of malaise. </p><p>Kalecgos dove and wheeled, letting the cold air caress his scales, then opening his wings and catching an updraft, his thoughts once again brooding and unhappy. </p><p>For so long, even during Malygos&#x2019;s insanity, the blues had had direction. The question of what to do now had been thought and sometimes whispered. Kalecgos could not help but wonder if he had somehow failed his flight. Had they really been better under the leadership of an insane Aspect? The immediate answer was of course not, and yet... and yet. </p><p>He closed his eyes, not against the needle-sharp snow, but in pain. <i>Their hearts trusted me to lead them. I believe I did lead them well then, but... now? Where do blue dragons&#x2014;any dragons&#x2014;fit in a world where the Hour of Twilight has been prevented but only an endless night looms before us?</i> </p><p>He felt utterly alone. He had always deemed himself perhaps the oddest choice possible to lead the blue dragonflight, as he had never really felt like a &#x201c;typical&#x201d; blue dragon. As he flew, despondent and increasingly concerned, he realized that there was at least one who understood him better than most. He leaned to the right, angling his great form slightly, and flapped his wings, heading back toward the Nexus. </p><p>He knew where he would find her. </p><p><b>� � �</b> </p><p>Kirygosa, daughter of Malygos, clutch sister to Arygos, sat in her human form on one of the magical, luminous floating platforms that encircled the Nexus. She wore only a long, loose dress, and her blue-black hair was not braided. Her back was against one of the shining, silver-white trees that dotted a few of the platforms. Above her, blue dragons wheeled as they had for centuries, ceaselessly patrolling, although there seemed to be no threat here, not anymore. Kirygosa appeared to pay them no heed, her gaze soft and unfocused. She appeared lost in thought, though what occupied her mind, Kalecgos did not know. </p><p>She did turn to look at him as he drew closer, smiling a little as she realized he was not one of the guardians of the flight&#x2019;s home. He landed on the platform and assumed his half-elven shape. Kiry&#x2019;s smile widened and she held out a hand to him. He kissed it affectionately and plopped down beside her, extending his long legs and folding his arms behind his head in an effort at nonchalance. </p><p>&#x201c;Kalec,&#x201d; she said warmly. &#x201c;Come to my pondering place?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is that what this is?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;For me, yes. The Nexus is my home, so I don&#x2019;t like to go too far, but it can be challenging to be alone inside.&#x201d; She turned to face him. &#x201c;So I come here, and I ponder. Just as you seem to want to do.&#x201d; </p><p>Kalec sighed, realizing that his effort at casualness was lost on this perceptive friend he often thought of as a sister. &#x201c;I was flying,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;You cannot fly away from your duties, or your thoughts,&#x201d; Kirygosa replied gently, reaching to squeeze his arm. &#x201c;You are our leader, Kalec. And you have guided us well. Arygos would have destroyed the flight and the whole world with it.&#x201d; </p><p>Kalec frowned, remembering the dire vision that Ysera, the former green Dragon Aspect, had shared with them all not so long ago. It was the Hour of Twilight&#x2014;and showed an Azeroth in which all life was wiped out. From the grass and the insects to orcs, elves, humans, creatures of air and sea and land, to the mighty Aspects themselves, who had each been slain by his or her own unique powers. Deathwing had died then, too, along with the rest of Azeroth&#x2014;impaled like a grotesque trophy on the spire of Wyrmrest Temple itself. Kalecgos shuddered, disturbed even now by the memory of Ysera&#x2019;s lilting but broken voice relaying the vision. </p><p>&#x201c;He would have done that,&#x201d; Kalec said, agreeing with part of her statement but not all of it. </p><p>Her blue eyes searched his. &#x201c;Dear Kalec,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you have always been... different.&#x201d; </p><p>Humor flickered in him despite his dark mood, and he made a silly face, twisting his handsome half-elven features. Kirygosa laughed. &#x201c;You see?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Different is not always a good thing,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;It is who you are, and it is because you were different that the flight chose you.&#x201d; </p><p>The humor melted away and he regarded her somberly. &#x201c;But, my dear Kirygosa,&#x201d; he said sadly, &#x201c;do you think the flight would choose me again, now?&#x201d; </p><p>Truth had ever been one of Kirygosa&#x2019;s most cherished ideals. She looked at him, searching for an answer that was both true and comforting, and not finding it. Kalec&#x2019;s heart sank. If this beloved friend, his sweet sister of the spirit, had no encouragement to offer, then his fears were more real than he had suspected. </p><p>&#x201c;What I <i>do</i> think is&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>He would never know what she thought, for they were interrupted by a sudden terrible sound&#x2014;the cries of blue dragons in despair and anguish. More than a dozen dragons were emerging from the Nexus, flying and diving about erratically. One of them abruptly swerved from his fellows, heading straight for Kalecgos. Kalec leaped to his feet, blood draining from his face. Kiry stood beside him, hand to her mouth. </p><p>&#x201c;Lord Kalecgos!&#x201d; Narygos cried. &#x201c;We are ruined! All is lost!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What has happened? Slow down, speak calmly, my friend!&#x201d; said Kalec, although his own heart lurched within his chest at the sheer panic and terror emanating from Narygos. The other dragon was usually calm and had been one of the more open-minded blues during the tense time when Kalec and Arygos were vying for the role of Aspect. To see him so distraught alarmed Kalecgos. </p><p>&#x201c;The Focusing Iris! It is gone!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Gone? What do you mean?&#x201d; </p><p><i>&#x201c;It has been stolen!&#x201d;</i> </p><p>Kalec stared at him, sick with horror, his mind reeling. Not only was the Focusing Iris an item of immense arcane power, but it was also deeply precious to the blues. It had belonged to them for as long as anyone could remember. Like many such items, it was neither good nor evil in itself but could be turned to both benevolent and sinister purposes. And it had been used so. In the past, it had diverted the arcane energy of Azeroth and to animate a hideous creature that should never have drawn breath. </p><p>To think it was now lost to them, lost and being controlled by those who might use its power&#x2014; </p><p>&#x201c;This is exactly why we moved it,&#x201d; Kalecgos murmured. Not two days ago, in an effort to avoid this very circumstance, Kalecgos, along with several others, had recommended moving the Focusing Iris out of the Eye of Eternity and into a secret hiding place. He recalled his argument to the blues: &#x201c;<i>Many of our secrets are already known, and more of our flight leaves each day.

In playing-card terminology, the court cards are also called royalty or face cards and, in seventeenth-century England, they were known as "coat cards" because of the elaborate coats or robes in which the figures were depicted. Some modern Tarot authors call them people cards in an effort to democratize them. In France and Italy, they are called figura or "figure" cards. Thus, the Tarot court are figures representing four different ranks of power and influence, in four different suits, elements, or domains. Since their heads or faces are usually prominent, and may be in profile or straight forward, the way they literally face can play an important part in interpretation. There are many different ways to interpret the court cards. Determining which perspective is applicable in any given situation is part of the art of reading the cards.Most of this book is devoted to illuminating these different perspectives. Frequently more than one perspective will offer insights in the same reading, so it's good to get into the habit of scanning the possibilities. In a reading, a court card may mean: A person in the your life, identified by his or her physical attributes,his or her profession, or the role he or she plays in the situation being examined (the Queen of Swords may represent a diplomatic, objective woman who acts as counselor or mediator, for example) An aspect of your personality, style or attitude, or a role you are playing(the Knight ofWands may express your impetuous, impulsive side) A relationship between the querent and another person (the Page ofPentacles is financially dependent on the king and so may represent dependency in a relationship) A spiritual influence at work in your life (the Knight of Cups maybe a surge of emotional energy, producing excitement and romantic advances) An event or situation (the Page of Swords may be a message or pieceof news about an important legal or business matter) These interpretations of the court cards will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters of this book. Other interpretations are possible as well. In fact, the possibilities are vast because the court cards have been interpreted in many different ways throughout the centuries. This book emphasizes interpretations that center on the idea of persona, whether one's own or that of another. <p>Suit and Rank It is important to get to know the basic court figures and the terms we will be using for them in this book. The minor arcana cards are divided into four suits that usually correspond to the four elements. The court cards are divided into four ranks, originally indicating a relative position in society. The result is a 4 x 4 matrix of sixteen cards. However, the names, correspondences, and characteristics of suit and rank vary greatly from deck to deck. In some decks, especially pagan-oriented ones, wands (or batons) are associated with the element of air, while swords are fire. In the Brotherhood of Light Egyptian Tarot, coins (pentacles) are air, wands are earth, and swords are fire. There are even a few rare decks where cups are air, and swords are water. This book will use the most common system, in which wands are fire and swords air, as its default, without intending for it to be seen as the only or best system. Feel free to use whatever elemental system you prefer. </p><p>Suits / Elements </p><p>wands / fire The suit of wands is also known as batons, staves, rods, scepters, or clubs. Its element is fire, and it represents the desire for growth, and subsequently signifies: the inspiration that moves things, the desire that leads the way, the future- oriented aspiration that initiates action.Wands have a purpose behind every action, and find value primarily in the meaning of an experience while lacking appreciation for the form.Wands indicate the desire for self-growth and creativity. They want to expand awareness, as well as set everything on fire with their enthusiasm. When you get a wands card, you might want to ask yourself:What has fired your interest? Do you have a burning desire to do something? Are you feeling burned out? Are you seeing red? What is erupting within you? Wands generally signify: Projects Innovation Risk Energy Taking action Self-growth Spirit Inspiration Thesis Creativity Initiation Enthusiasm Desire Passion Perception Action Movement Optimismcups / water </p><p>The suit of cups is also known as chalices, vessels, bowls, containers, or hearts. Its element is water, and water takes the form of whatever it flows into. Therefore cups are amiable but, at the same time, diffused. Cups represent going with the flow and seeking to merge. They receive the impulse from the fiery wands and respond to it. They represent love, relationship, and imagination, and provide nurturance and a sense of connectedness. Cups can open you to your inner feelings and the connections you have with others. Choices at this level seem instinctual.

But even tough guys have their secrets. Plagued by the memory of his abusive father, apprehensive about his own impending parenthood, Earl is a decorated ex-Marine of absolute integrity -- and overwhelming melancholy. Now he's about to face his biggest, bloodiest challenge yet. <br> It is the summer of 1946, organized crime's garish golden age, when American justice seems to have gone to seed for good. Nowhere is this more true than in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the reigning capital of corruption. When the district attorney vows to bring down the mob, Earl is recruited to run the show. As casino raids erupt into nerve-shattering combat amid screaming prostitutes and fleeing johns, the body count mounts -- along with the suspense.</p><p>You can get anything you want in postwar Hot Springs, Arkansas--girls, gambling, drugs, or booze--courtesy of gangster Owney Madden, a picaresque character who affects jodhpurs, ascots, and an English accent to disguise his origins in New York's Hell's Kitchen. A county prosecutor, ambitious for higher office, sees Madden's destruction as the key to his political future, and he thinks Medal of Honor winner Earl Swagger is the right man to break Madden's stranglehold on the corrupt city. <p> A decent man haunted by his warrior past as well as the memory of his suffering at the hands of an abusive father, Earl yearns for the peace and quiet of domesticity with his wife Junie and the child she carries. But his need for "the hot pounding of the gun, the furious intensity of it all," is even more compelling. Earl's fearlessness in the face of danger is his defense against guilt over having survived both the war and his father's cruelty. Tasked with training a commando cadre to destroy Madden's criminal enterprise, Earl finds a way to channel his violent nature in the service of justice, despite his suspicions about his boss's political agenda, which threatens to compromise his assignment and destroy his team. </p><p> A prequel to Stephen Hunter's three well-reviewed suspense thrillers starring Earl's son, former marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (<i>Point of Impact</i>, <i>Black Light</i>, <i>Dirty White Boys</i>), <i>Hot Springs</i> is bloody, hard-boiled fiction at its best. Hunter's precise descriptions of combat, hardware, and commando training are rendered in spare, uncluttered prose, and the melodrama around a key subplot--Earl's tangled, love-hate relationship with his murdered father--enhances rather than detracts from the novel's superb pacing and powerful narrative. Another subplot, involving Madden's rivalry with Bugsy Siegel, whose plan to create a rival sin city in Las Vegas threatens his own prominence, is less successful, but that's a minor quibble. While it's the only part of <i>Hot Springs</i> that doesn't fully engage the reader, it highlights Hunter's verisimilitude in depicting the heady post-World War II era. This is a highly readable book that should send grateful fans to Hunter's backlist as soon as they've turned the last page. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Stephen Hunter has written over twenty novels.

It is hard to imagine a more expressive cow than this title's cartoon bovine. On the first page, the cow has a contented, peaceful moo. Turn a page, and she has an inquisitive, &#x201c;Moo?&#x201d; when she sees a car for sale; soon enough, she's on a joyride up and down the hillsides. The cow is the focus of each bright, borderless spread, and some pages include comedic close-ups of her face. The word &#x201c;moo&#x201d; appears on most spreads in a variety of font sizes, from tiny to gigantic, depending on the emotion of the moment. Children will laugh at the use of type and the artful arrangement of letters to convey action and sound. For example, when the cow drives off a cliff, her moo arcs up and then loops down, indicating the rise and fall of her bellow. For many children, this book will be their first introduction to punctuation. Even the very young will see how exclamation points and dashes can create a choppy, nervous feeling when the cow is confronted by a police officer. This book is bold, original, and funny, and should be part of every picture-book collection.&#x2013;Jess deCourcy Hinds, Bard High School Early College, Queens, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

She lives near Kansas City.<b>ONE</b><p>The first time she slit a man&#x2019;s throat she felt sick to her stomach. The second time? Not so much.<br>After she cut five or six more, the blade in her left hand began to feel like an extension of her body, and she started to take it all in stride. The exhilaration subsided, and so did the nausea. There was no longer a rush of anxiety, no longer a racing heartbeat. Blood didn&#x2019;t faze her. The thrill was gone, and that, in her line of work, was a very good thing.<br>Dr. Eleanor Kathleen Sullivan, or Ellie as she was called by her family and friends, was just four days shy of completing a grueling surgical fellowship in one of the busiest trauma centers in the Midwest. Since trauma was her specialty, she had certainly seen her share of mangled and brutalized bodies. It was her responsibility to put them back together, and as a senior fellow, she had the added duty of training the first &#x2013; and second-year residents.<br>St. Vincent&#x2019;s emergency room had been full since 4:00 A.M. that morning, and Ellie was finishing what she hoped was her last surgery of the day, a repair of a splenic rupture. A teenager, barely old enough to have a driver&#x2019;s license, had decided to test the limits of the speedometer in his parents&#x2019; Camry and had lost control, rolling the car over an embankment and landing upside down in an open field. Lucky for him, he had been wearing a seat belt, and luckier still, a man following some distance behind him had seen the whole thing and was able to call for an ambulance immediately. The boy made it to the emergency room just in time.<br>Ellie was observed by three second-year surgical residents, who hung on her every word. She was a natural teacher and, unlike 90 percent of the surgeons on staff at St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, didn&#x2019;t have much of an ego. She was amazingly patient with the medical students and residents. While she worked, she explained&#x2014;and explained again&#x2014;until they finally understood what she was doing and why. No question was deemed too insignificant or foolish, which was one of the many reasons they idolized her, and for the male residents, the fact that she was drop-dead gorgeous didn&#x2019;t hurt. Because she was such a talented surgeon and supportive teacher, all these fledgling doctors fought to sign up for her rotation. Ironically, what they didn&#x2019;t know was that she was younger than most of them.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re off duty this weekend, aren&#x2019;t you, Ellie?&#x201d;<br>Ellie glanced over at Dr. Kevin Andrews, the anesthesiologist, who had asked the question. He had joined the staff six months before and, since the day he&#x2019;d met Ellie, had been hounding her to go out with him. He was an outrageous flirt and yet very sweet. Blond hair, blue eyes, tall and well built with an adorable smile, he could turn the head of almost every woman in the hospital, but for Ellie there just wasn&#x2019;t any spark.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I am. I have the whole weekend off,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Charlie, would you like to close up for me?&#x201d; she asked one of the hovering residents.<br>&#x201c;Absolutely, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You better hurry,&#x201d; Andrews said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waking him up.&#x201d;<br>The resident looked panic-stricken.<br>&#x201c;Take your time, Charlie. He&#x2019;s just messing with you,&#x201d; she said, a smile in her voice.<br>&#x201c;Tuesday&#x2019;s your last day at St. Vincent&#x2019;s, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Andrews asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Tuesday&#x2019;s my last official day. I might help out on a temporary basis later on, but I&#x2019;m not promising anything yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you could decide to come back permanently.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t reply.<br>He persisted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll give you anything you want. You could name your price, your hours . . . you should stay here, Ellie. You belong here.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t agree or disagree. In truth, she didn&#x2019;t know where she belonged. It had been such a hard road to get this far, she hadn&#x2019;t had time to think about the future. At least that was the excuse she used for her indecision.<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she finally conceded. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br>She stood over Charlie, watching like a mother hen. &#x201c;I want those stitches tight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So Monday night is my last chance to take you to heaven?&#x201d; Andrews asked in a teasing drawl.<br>She laughed. &#x201c;Heaven? Last week you were going to rock my world. Now you&#x2019;re going to take me to heaven?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guarantee it. I&#x2019;ve got testimonials if you want to see them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to happen, Kevin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving up.&#x201d;<br>She sighed. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>As she checked the last suture, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck to one side then the other to get the kinks out. She&#x2019;d been in the OR since 5:00 A.M., which meant she had been bent over patients for eleven hours. Sad to say, that wasn&#x2019;t a record for her.<br>She felt wrung out and stiff and sore. A good run around the park would get those muscles moving, she decided, maybe even rev up her energy.<br>&#x201c;You know what would help you get rid of a stiff neck?&#x201d; Andrews said.<br>&#x201c;Let me guess. A trip to heaven?&#x201d;<br>One of the nurses snorted with laughter. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s awfully persistent, Dr. Sullivan. Maybe you should give in.&#x201d;<br>Ellie removed her gloves and dropped them in the trash bag by the OR doors. &#x201c;Thanks, Megan, but I think I&#x2019;ll just go for a run instead.&#x201d; As she pushed the doors wide, she untied her surgical mask and pulled off her cap, shaking her blond hair loose to fall to her shoulders.<br>Twenty minutes later she was officially off duty. She changed into her workout clothes, a pair of faded red shorts and a white tank top. She double-tied her beat-up running shoes, grabbed a rubber band and swept her hair up in a ponytail, slipped her iPod into one pocket and her cell phone into the other, and she was ready. Walking a maze of corridors to get outside, she avoided the direct route through the ER for fear she&#x2019;d get waylaid with another case.<br>There was never a lack of patients rolling through the doors. Along with the usual emergencies&#x2014;the car accidents, the heart attacks, the work injuries&#x2014;the ER saw a steady stream of victims of violent crimes. The vast majority were young men. Gangs roamed the area east of the highway, and shooting one another seemed to be a nightly sport. Since St. Vincent&#x2019;s was the largest trauma center in St. Louis, all the serious cases came to them. Weekends were a nightmare for the staff. There were times, especially during the hot summer months, when gurneys lined the halls of the ER with patients handcuffed to the railings while they waited to go into surgery. Additional police had to be routinely called in to monitor them to make certain one gang member hadn&#x2019;t been placed too close to a rival.<br>Ellie became a member of the One Hundred Club when she removed her one hundredth bullet. It wasn&#x2019;t a club she wanted to join, but she would always remember the case. The young man was only twenty years old, and it was the third time he&#x2019;d been shot. She couldn&#x2019;t forget his insolence and his cold, empty eyes. They were almost as lifeless as the cadavers down in the morgue. Patching up these boys so that they could return to the streets and the same violence was heart wrenching, and she prayed, with every surgery, that this time they would learn something, that this time they would find a new life. It was a naive hope, but she clung to it anyway.<br>Like the other overworked and underpaid residents and fellows, Ellie operated on broken bodies, the consequence of violence. But she had never actually witnessed a crime . . . until today.<br>It was a hot and humid late afternoon. Two medical students had caught up with Ellie just as she began her run on the onemile track in Cambridge Park, a vast area that sat adjacent to the hospital. Heavy rain clouds hung over them, and all three panted for air. After the first mile, both students dropped out, but Ellie was determined to get in at least one more mile before calling it quits. She made mental lists as she ran. She had a million things to do before heading home to Winston Falls.<br>Dear God, it was muggy. The humidity was so thick, she felt as though she were running through a sauna. Sweat trickled down the back of her neck, and her drenched clothes clung to her body. Her friend Jennifer, a nurse in pediatrics, who was taking a shortcut across the track to get to the ER entrance, shouted to Ellie that she was crazy to run in this heat. Ellie waved and continued on. She probably was crazy, but getting any time to work out was such a luxury, she couldn&#x2019;t afford to be choosy about the weather.<br>Ellie could hear faint cheering coming from the new soccer field across the street to the north, and as she rounded the curve, she saw the players&#x2014;high school &#x2013; age girls&#x2014;sprinting across the field. From the large number of fans in the bleachers, she guessed it was an important game.<br>The administrator of the hospital, the board, and a plethora of attorneys had fought the soccer field. They wanted to purchase the land to build another huge parking garage, and Ellie was happy they had lost their bid. Like the track and small playground to the south, the soccer field was far enough away from the hospital that, no matter how much noise the teams and fans made, the patients weren&#x2019;t disturbed.<br>Ellie was a football, basketball, and soccer fan, in that order. She loved to watch most sporting events. She admired the grace, skill, and finesse of the players, probably because she didn&#x2019;t possess any of those attributes herself. She had been such an awkward child, her mother had enrolled her in ballet classes, and she never got to play a sport. When she wasn&#x2019;t tripping over her own feet trying to do a pli�, she was reading. She was much more comfortable with her books. Her aunt Vivien liked to call her a bookworm.<br>No time to watch any games today, she thought. She had way too much to do. She returned to her mental list of things to be accomplished before she could head home to her sister&#x2019;s wedding. Oh God, how she dreaded that. She wished she had another week to get ready for the ordeal; then admitted to herself that no amount of time would prepare her for the whispers and the sympathetic smiles from her friends and family. Who could blame them? After all, her sister Ava was marrying Ellie&#x2019;s ex-fianc�. It was going to be a week of mortification, she decided. But, hey, she was tough. She could handle it.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>And then there was Evan Patterson. Just thinking about him made her stomach hurt. Would he dare show up in Winston Falls? God, she hoped not. But if he did, would she need to get another restraining order, even if she was going to be home for only a few days? She could feel herself getting worked up and had to force herself to calm down. She was an adult now, and she could handle anything that came her way. Even a maniac, she told herself. Besides, she was sure Evan wasn&#x2019;t back in Winston Falls. If he had returned, her father would have alerted her.<br>Ellie didn&#x2019;t want to worry about Patterson now or think about the wedding. Instead, she chose to focus on the task at hand. Just a little more than a half mile to go, then a lovely cold shower. She took her earphones from her pocket and was about to turn on her iPod to listen to a lecture on new thoracotomy procedures when she heard a loud pop.<br>Ellie stopped running. Lightning? She looked up at the ominous sky just as another pop echoed, then a third and a fourth in rapid succession. Had lightning hit a transformer? That would explain the bursts . . . except there hadn&#x2019;t been any lightning.<br>Gunshots? Had to be. As many bullets as Ellie had removed from gunshot victims, she&#x2019;d never actually heard the sound of a gun firing. The noise came from somewhere up ahead. She glanced to the right toward the soccer field. No panic there. The game was still going on, so she had to be wrong. If not gunshots . . . then what?<br>Five or six seconds had passed since the first popping sound. Ellie reached for her earphones again. Okay, she&#x2019;d been mistaken.<br>Then the screaming started.<br>Everything happened so fast. In the span of just a few more seconds, Ellie observed the chaotic scene unfold in front of her as though it were happening in slow motion.<br>In the distance, several men, wearing navy blue T-shirts and vests with FBI in bold yellow letters printed on the back, appeared almost out of nowhere and fanned out as they raced toward the trees in the center of the park. People were scattering every which way. Screams mingled with the cheers from the soccer field, the fans and players apparently oblivious to what was happening. A father ran from the playground toward the street with two little boys. The children weren&#x2019;t able to keep up, so the father scooped them into his arms and kept running. Several people who had been strolling through the park also scrambled to get away, as did three boys who had been tossing a Frisbee. One of the boys ran into the street, directly in front of an ambulance returning to the hospital. The vehicle came to a screeching halt, and the boy rushed around to the open window shouting something to the paramedic as he pointed toward the trees.<br>Suddenly, a man and a woman, linked arm in arm, drew her attention. They walked briskly toward her on the running path. There was something off about both of them. The man had a thick mustache. He wore dark glasses, a baseball cap pulled down over his forehead, and a brown, hooded windbreaker zipped up to his neck, a peculiar choice in the 90-degree weather. Was he all bundled up to keep his clothes dry when the storm broke? The man looked over his shoulder, his neck glistening with sweat. The woman looked directly at Ellie. Her bizarre appearance was startling. A short black wig sat slightly askew on her head with a few long hairs hanging down the side of her neck. Her eyes were such an intense, unnatural shade of green, she looked as though she were wearing novelty contacts, the ones you&#x2019;d buy for a Halloween party. When the couple was about thirty feet away from Ellie, they veered toward the street.<br>Someone shouted a command. Then one of the FBI agents who had run into the trees appeared and headed straight for the pair. The woman let go of the man and began to run as he slowed and pulled something from his coat pocket. When he whirled around to face the agent shouting at him, Ellie saw the gun. Before she could react, he&#x2019;d fired two shots. The first bullet struck the man in pursuit, the force so great it knocked him back before he crashed to the ground. The second bullet went wild. As Ellie dived to the grass, the shooter spun around and pointed the gun toward her. He didn&#x2019;t pull the trigger but instead ran to the street and jumped into a car that sped away.<br>The ambulance had just turned around to go in the direction the boys were pointing, but when the gunshots were fired, it changed course. Sirens on, the ambulance crossed over the curb and swerved to miss the hospital emergency entrance sign. It bounded across the park toward the gunshot victim, weaving in and out of the crowd that was scrambling toward the boulevard.<br>Ellie jumped to her feet and ran after it. Her mind was racing. Who were the surgeons on call tonight? Edmonds and Walmer, she remembered, and she&#x2019;d seen both of them in the hospital. Good.<br>The target had been a good distance away from the shooter, but he&#x2019;d taken a direct hit to the torso. Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he&#x2019;d make it to the OR.<br>The ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in...</p></p><h2>The Cat Who Came to Breakfast</h2><p><b>Jim Qwilleran and his cats scramble for clues when peaceful Breakfast Island is turned upside-down by murder in this mystery in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Cat Who series.</b><br><br>Qwilleran and the cats are visiting an island known by many names. Qwill has always called it Breakfast Island, but to the taciturn natives, it&#x2019;s Providence Island. To the rich summer resident, it&#x2019;s Grand Island&#x2014;and to the developers and tourists who are turning this once-peaceful place into a circus, it&#x2019;s Pear Island. But when some odd &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; occur, including a fatal boat explosion, Qwill suspects sabotage and sets out to investigate&#x2014;because murder by any other name is just as deadly...</p><p>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.Van Patten&#39;s narration is perfectly paced to reflect the backwoods antics of newspaperman Qwilleran and his detective felines, Koko and Yum-Yum. Patten distinguishes well among the many characters, especially the yowls and meows of the precocious Siamese. His characterization of the elegantly simple Qwilleran is superb. The abridgment handles the quirky storyline well but misses some of the folksy humor of Moose County. The overall effect is enjoyable and clever. A.L.M. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>MS.

She didn&#x2019;t hear the music, used it more to fill the airthan as entertainment while she painstakingly pieced the completedpanel onto the second tier of four. </p><p>She stepped back to eye the results, to circle, to search for flaws.Vows&#x2019; clients expected perfect, and that&#x2019;s exactly what she intendedto deliver. Satisfied, she nodded, and picked up a bottle of water tosip while she stretched her back. </p><p>&#x201c;Two down, two to go.&#x201d; </p><p>She glanced toward the board where she&#x2019;d pinned various samplesof antique lace, and the final sketched design for the cake Fridayevening&#x2019;s bride had approved. </p><p>She had three more designs to complete: two for Saturday, onefor Sunday&#x2014;but that was nothing new. June at Vows, the weddinga nd event business she ran with her friends, was prime time.</p><p>In a handful of years, they&#x2019;d turned an idea into a thriving enterprise.Sometimes just a little too thriving, she mused, which waswhy she was making fondant lace at nearly one in the morning. </p><p>It was a very good thing, she decided. She loved the work. </p><p>They all had their passions. Emma had the flowers, Mac the photography,Parker the details. And she had the cakes. And the pastries,she thought, and the chocolates. But the cakes stood as the crowningtouch. </p><p>She got back to it, began to roll out the next panel. Followinghabit, she&#x2019;d clipped her sunny blond hair up and back out of herway. Cornstarch dusted the baker&#x2019;s apron she wore over cottonpants and tee, and the slide-on kitchen shoes kept her feet as comfortableas possible after hours of standing. Her hands, strong fromyears of kneading, rolling, lifting, were capable and quick. As shebegan the next pattern, her sharp-featured, angular face set in seriouslines. </p><p>Perfection wasn&#x2019;t simply a goal when it came to her art. ForIcing at Vows it was a necessity. The wedding cake was more thanbaking and piping, sugar paste and filling. Just as the wedding photosMac took were more than pictures, and the arrangements andbouquets Emma created more than flowers. The details and schedulesand wishes Parker put together were, in the end, bigger thanthe sum of their parts. </p><p>Together, the elements became a once-in-a-lifetime event, andthe celebration of the journey two people chose to make together. </p><p>Romantic, certainly, and Laurel believed in romance. In theory,anyway. More, she believed in symbols and celebrations. And in areally fabulous cake. </p><p>Her expression softened into pleasure as she completed thethird tier, and her deep blue eyes warmed as she glanced over tosee Parker hovering in the doorway. </p><p>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you in bed?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Details.&#x201d; Parker circled a finger over her own head. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;tsettle. How long have you been at this tonight?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Awhile. I need to finish it so it can set overnight. Plus I havethe two Saturday cakes to assemble and decorate tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Want company?&#x201d; </p><p>They knew each other well enough that it was understood ifLaurel said no, there&#x2019;d be no off ense. And often, when deep in work,no was the answer. </p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I love the design.&#x201d; Parker, as Laurel had, circled the cake. &#x201c;Thedelicacy of the white on white, the interest of the diff erent heightsof each tier&#x2014;and the intricacy of each. They really do look like differentpanels of lace. Old-fashioned, vintage, that&#x2019;s our bride&#x2019;s theme.You&#x2019;ve nailed it with this.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to do pale blue ribbon around the pedestal,&#x201d; Laurelsaid as she started on the next panel. &#x201c;And Emma&#x2019;s going to scatterwhite rose petals at the base. It&#x2019;s going to be a winner.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The bride&#x2019;s been good to work with.&#x201d; </p><p>Comfortable in her pajamas, her long brown hair loose ratherthan in its work mode of sleek tail or smooth chignon, Parker puton the kettle for tea. One of the perks of running the business outof her home, and of having Laurel living there&#x2014;with Emma andParker right on the estate as well&#x2014;were these late-night visits. </p><p>&#x201c;She knows her mind,&#x201d; Laurel commented, choosing a tool toscallop the edges of the panel. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s open to suggestion, and sofar hasn&#x2019;t been insane. If she makes it through the next twenty-fourthat way, she&#x2019;ll definitely earn Vows&#x2019; coveted Good Bride status.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They looked happy and relaxed tonight at rehearsal, and that&#x2019;sa good sign.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Laurel continued the pattern with precisely placedeyelets and dots. &#x201c;So, again, why aren&#x2019;t you in bed?&#x201d; </p><p>Parker sighed as she heated a little teapot. &#x201c;I think I was havinga moment. I was unwinding with a glass of wine out on my terrace.I could see Mac&#x2019;s place, and Emma&#x2019;s. The lights were on inboth houses, and I could smell the gardens. It was so quiet, sopretty. The lights went off &#x2014;Emma&#x2019;s first, and a little while after,Mac&#x2019;s. I thought how we&#x2019;re planning Mac&#x2019;s wedding, and thatEmma just got engaged. And all the times we played Wedding Day,the four of us, when we were kids. Now it&#x2019;s real. I sat there in thequiet and the dark, and found myself wishing my parents could behere to see it. To see what we&#x2019;ve done here, and who we are now.I got stuck.&#x201d; She paused to measure out tea. &#x201c;Between being sadthey&#x2019;re gone and being happy because I know they&#x2019;d be proud ofme. Of us.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I think about them a lot. We all do.&#x201d; Laurel continued to work.&#x201c;Because they were such an essential part of our lives, and becausethere are so many memories of them here. So I know what youmean by being stuck.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d get a kick out of Mac and Carter, out of Emma andJack, wouldn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, they would. And what we&#x2019;ve done here, Parker? It rocks.They&#x2019;d get a kick out of that, too.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m lucky you were up working.&#x201d; Parker poured hot waterinto the pot. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve settled me down.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Here to serve. I&#x2019;ll tell you who else is lucky, and that&#x2019;s Friday&#x2019;sbride. Because this cake?&#x201d; She blew stray hair out of her eyes as shenodded smugly. &#x201c;It kicks major ass. And when I do the crown,angels will weep with joy.&#x201d; </p><p>Parker set the pot aside to steep. &#x201c;Really, Laurel, you need totake more pride in your work.&#x201d; </p><p>Laurel grinned. &#x201c;Screw the tea. I&#x2019;m nearly done here. Pour mea glass of wine.&#x201d; </p><p>In the morning, after a solid six hours&#x2019; sleep, Laurel got ina quick session at the gym before dressing for the workday. She&#x2019;dbe chained in her kitchen for the bulk of it, but before that routinebegan, there was the summit meeting that prefaced every event. </p><p>Laurel dashed downstairs from her third-floor wing to the mainlevel of the sprawling house, and back to the family kitchen whereMrs. Grady was putting a fruit platter together. </p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Mrs. G.&#x201d; </p><p>Mrs. Grady arched her eyebrows. &#x201c;You look feisty.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Feel feisty. Feel righteous.&#x201d; Laurel fisted both hands, flexed hermuscles. &#x201c;Want coff ee. Much.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s taken the coff ee up already. You can take this fruit, andthe pastries. Eat some of that fruit. A day shouldn&#x2019;t start with aDanish.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Anyone else here yet?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not yet, but I saw Jack&#x2019;s truck leave a bit ago, and I expectCarter will be along giving me the puppy eyes in hopes of a decentbreakfast.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get out of the way.&#x201d; Laurel grabbed the platters, balancingthem with the expertise of the waitress she&#x2019;d been once upona time. </p><p>She carried them up to the library, which now served as Vows&#x2019;conference room. Parker sat at the big table, with the coff ee serviceon the breakfront. Her BlackBerry, as always, remained at easyreach. The sleek ponytail left her face unframed, and the crispwhite shirt transmitted business mode as she sipped coff ee andstudied data on her laptop with midnight blue eyes Laurel knewmissed nothing. </p><p>&#x201c;Provisions,&#x201d; Laurel announced.

What time did you get up?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Six, which was a good thing, since Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s bridecalled just after seven.

What is, is&#x2014;and itmakes an amusing memory. In my opinion.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see what the bride&#x2019;s opinion is once he gets back fromthe doctor.&#x201d; Parker glanced over as Emma rushed in. </p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not late. There are twenty seconds left.&#x201d; Black curls bouncing,she scooted to the coff ee station. &#x201c;I fell back to sleep. After.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I hate you, too,&#x201d; Laurel muttered. &#x201c;We need a new rule.No bragging about sex at business meetings when half of us aren&#x2019;tgetting any.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Seconded,&#x201d; Parker said immediately. </p><p>&#x201c;Aww.&#x201d; Laughing, Emma scooped some fruit into a bowl. </p><p>&#x201c;Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s FOB may have a broken nose.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Aww,&#x201d; Emma repeated, with genuine concern at Mac&#x2019;sannouncement. </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll deal with it when we have more details, but however itturns out, it really falls to Mac and me. I&#x2019;ll keep you updated,&#x201d;Parker said to Mac. &#x201c;Tonight&#x2019;s event. All out-of-town attendants,relatives, and guests have arrived. The bride, the MOB, and theattendants are due here at three for hair and makeup. The MOGhas her own salon date and is due by four, with the FOG. FOB willarrive with his daughter. We&#x2019;ll keep him happy and occupied untilit&#x2019;s time for the formal shots that include him. Mac?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The bride&#x2019;s dress is a beaut. Vintage romance. I&#x2019;ll be playingthat up.&#x201d; </p><p>As Mac outlined her plans and timetable, Laurel rose for a secondcup of coff ee. She made notes here and there, continued to doso when Emma took over. As the bulk of Laurel&#x2019;s job was complete,she&#x2019;d fill in when and where she was needed. </p><p>It was a routine they&#x2019;d perfected since Vows had gone fromconcept to reality. </p><p>&#x201c;Laurel,&#x201d; Parker said. </p><p>&#x201c;The cake&#x2019;s finished&#x2014;and a wowzer. It&#x2019;s heavy, so I&#x2019;ll need helpfrom the subs transferring it to reception, but the design doesn&#x2019;trequire any on-site assembly. I&#x2019;ll need you to do the ribbon andwhite rose petals, Emma, once it&#x2019;s transferred, but that&#x2019;s it until it&#x2019;stime to serve. They opted against a groom&#x2019;s cake, and went for aselection of mini pastries and heart-shaped chocolates. They&#x2019;redone, too, and we&#x2019;ll serve them on white china lined with lace doiliesto mirror the design of the cake. The cake table linen is paleblue, eyelet lace. Cake knife and server, provided by the B and G.They were her grandmother&#x2019;s so we&#x2019;ll keep our eye on them. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be working on Saturday&#x2019;s cakes most of today,but should be freed up by four if anyone needs me. During the lastset, the subs will put leftover cake in the take-away boxes and tiethem with blue ribbon we&#x2019;ve had engraved with the B and G&#x2019;snames, and the date. Same goes if there are any leftover chocolatesor pastries. Mac, I&#x2019;d like a picture of the cake for my files. I haven&#x2019;tdone this design before.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Check.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And Emma, I need the flowers for Saturday night&#x2019;s cake. Canyou drop them off to me when you come to dress today&#x2019;s event?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;On the personal front?&#x201d; Mac lifted a hand for attention. &#x201c;Noone&#x2019;s mentioned that my mother&#x2019;s latest wedding is tomorrow, inItaly. Which is, thankfully, many, many miles away from our happyhome here in Greenwich, Connecticut. I got a call from her justafter five this morning, as Linda doesn&#x2019;t get the concept of timezones&#x2014;and, well, let&#x2019;s face it, doesn&#x2019;t give a shit anyway.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just let it ring?&#x201d; Laurel demanded, even asEmma reached over to rub Mac&#x2019;s leg in sympathy. </p><p>&#x201c;Because she&#x2019;d just keep calling back&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m trying to dealwith her. On my terms for a change.&#x201d; Mac raked her fingersthrough the bold red of her gamine cap of hair. &#x201c;There were, asexpected, tears and recriminations, as she&#x2019;s decided she wants methere. As opposed to a week ago, when she didn&#x2019;t. Since I have nointention of hopping on a plane, particularly when I have an eventtonight, two tomorrow, and another on Sunday, to see her get marriedfor the fourth time, she&#x2019;s not speaking to me.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;If only it would last.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Laurel,&#x201d; Parker murmured. </p><p>&#x201c;I mean it. You got to give her a piece of your mind,&#x201d; she remindedParker. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t. I can only let it fester.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Which I appreciate,&#x201d; Mac said. &#x201c;Sincerely. But as you can see,I&#x2019;m not in a funk, I&#x2019;m not swimming in guilt or even marginallypissed off . I think there&#x2019;s an advantage to finding a guy who&#x2019;s sensible,loving, and just really solid. An advantage over and abovereally terrific morning sex. Every one of you has been on my sidewhen I&#x2019;ve had to deal with Linda, you&#x2019;ve tried to help me throughher demands and basic insanity. I guess Carter just helped tip thescales, and now I can deal with it. I wanted to tell you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have morning sex with him myself, just for that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hands off , McBane. But I appreciate the sentiment. So.&#x201d; Sherose. &#x201c;I want to get some work done before I need to focus on today&#x2019;sevent. I&#x2019;ll swing by and get some shots of the cake.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hang on, I&#x2019;ll go with you.&#x201d; Emma pushed up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back withthe team shortly&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll drop the flowers off for you, Laurel.&#x201d; </p><p>When they&#x2019;d gone, Laurel sat another moment. &#x201c;She reallymeant it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she really did.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Laurel took a last moment to sit back and relaxwith her coff ee. &#x201c;Carter&#x2019;s the one who turned the key in the lock.I wonder what it&#x2019;s like to have a man who can do that, can help thatway without pushing. Who can love you that way. I guess when itcomes down to it, I envy her that even more than the sex.&#x201d;</p><p>Shrugging, Laurel rose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get to work.&#x201d; </p><p>Laurel didn&#x2019;t have time to think about men over the nextcouple of days. She didn&#x2019;t have the time or the energy to thinkabout love and romance. She might have been neck-deep in wed-dings, but that was business&#x2014;and the business of weddings demandedfocus and precision. </p><p>Her Antique Lace cake, which had taken her nearly three days tocreate, had its moment in the spotlight&#x2014;before being disassembledand devoured.

It will entertain and inform, delight and (perhaps) infuriate, providing a subject for lively debate and ready reference for years to come.</p><p>As a nuts-and-bolts operagoer's guide, Denis Forman's book is richly incisive. It's equally satisfying as a tart, effervescent take on the solemn world of opera. <p> The author--a British television executive and former deputy chairman of the Royal Opera House--covers most of the likely offerings of your local repertory company, with a few questionable omissions (<i>Peter Grimes</i>) and inclusions (<i>The Threepenny Opera</i>). For each he provides a synopsis, musical highlights, critical remarks, and historical information (the premiere of <i>Il Trovatore</i>: "stupendous"; that of <i>Norma</i>: "a flop"). Another section offers comments on everything from the craze for authenticity to the practice of booing.</p><p> Forman's opinions sometimes run athwart of convention. <i>Falstaff</i> "has no sex appeal and no heart, and opera demands both these qualities"; <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> is the creation of "the Wagner that liked to spend time stroking velvet." His tone, especially in the synopses, is often evocative of Anna Russell's opera parodies: "It really is too bad of you Tristan to die on me like this. She passes out." </p><p> The prose can be cute, but that fits Forman's approach of puncturing the inflated atmosphere of opera while glorying in it. Though he is most entertaining when he's daring to shout in church, his enthusiasms are as illuminating as his barbs. "<i>Traviata</i> is the first grown-up opera about contemporary life," he says, adroitly locating that work in operatic history. In <i>Don Giovanni</i>, "Mozart brought terror to the opera stage for the first time." It's the book's greatest pleasure that Forman's passion is matched by his knowledge. <i>--David Olivenbaum</i></p>With an encyclopedic knowledge of opera and a delightful dash of irreverence, Sir Denis Forman throws open the world of opera--its structure, composers, conductors, and artists--in this hugely informative guide.

We measure our worth by what others think of us. We compare and strive, existing mostly for the approval of others. Pressure rises, anxiety creeps in and we hustle to keep up.</p><p>Jesus whispers, <em>I gave my life to set you free. I gave you purpose. I called you to live in freedom in that purpose.</em> Yet we still hobble through life, afraid to confess all the ways we push against this truth, because we can&#x2019;t even believe it. We continue to grasp for the approval of anyone that will offer it: whether strangers, friends, or community.</p><p><strong>Christ doesn&#x2019;t say you can be or may be or will be free. He says you are free.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Dare you believe it?</p><p>In <strong><em>You Are Free</em></strong>, Rebekah invites you to:</p><p>� Overcome the exhaustion of trying to meet the expectations of others and rest in the joy God&#x2019;s freedom brings.</p><p>� Release stress, anxiety and worry, to uncover the peace that comes from abiding in His presence.</p><p>� Find permission to grieve past experiences, confess areas of brokenness, and receive strength in your journey towards healing.</p><p>� Throw off self-condemnation, burn superficial masks and step boldly into what our good God has for you.</p><p>� Discover the courage to begin again and use your newfound freedom to set others free.</p><p>Freedom is for everyone who wants it&#x2014;the lost, the wounded, and those weary from all of the striving. It&#x2019;s for those who gave up trying years ago. It&#x2019;s for those angry and hurt, brilliant and burnt by the Christian song and dance. You are the church, the people of God. You were meant to be free.</p></p><p><p>Rebekah Lyons is a national speaker and bestselling author of&nbsp;<em>You Are Free: Be Who You Already Are&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Freefall to Fly: A Breathtaking Journey Toward a Life of Meaning</em>.&nbsp;An old soul with a contemporary, honest voice,&nbsp;Rebekah reveals her own battles to overcome anxiety and depression&#x2014;and invites others to discover and boldly pursue their God-given purpose.&nbsp;Alongside her husband, Gabe,&nbsp;Rebekah finds&nbsp;joy in raising&nbsp;four children, two of whom have Down syndrome.

I&#x2019;ve always been impressed with both the clarity of her message and the vulnerability and courage with which she delivers it. This book is no exception. It&#x2019;s not the story of her life, it&#x2019;s about what she&#x2019;s learned watching Jesus invade her life. She doesn&#x2019;t tell you what to do; she talks about who to trust. (<i>BOB GOFF, author of Love Does</i>)<br><br>We consider Rebekah and Gabe to be a Godsend in our lives. Many times after sharing a warm-hearted meal, we leave inspired to take yet another step and deeper stride into our own stories of freedom. In reading Rebekah's gracious and honest words, you will be inspired to take your own steps with him in freedom. May you find the sweet space where he tends to your heart, bringing life to places you can't currently fathom. May he surprise you with each turn of the page. (<i>CHRIS AND LAUREN TOMLIN, songwriter and worship leader</i>)<br><br>You Are Free sent me to my knees pleading with God to show me where I have missed the freedom he intended for me. It opened my eyes to places I was holding on to self, to doubt, to worry, and sent me in search of more intimacy and a deeper, fuller trust in him. Rebekah tells the truth about her journey as a child of God; a wife, mother, daughter, and friend. She invites us to a place where full reliance on him is the only way to truly be free. (<i>KORIE ROBERTSON, Duck Dynasty</i>)<br><br>When we first met Rebekah, we felt known and loved immediately. That's what reading You Are Free is like. Rebekah invites you to peek into her journey as she finds freedom in Christ and invites us to do the same. This book is an anthem for healing, freedom, and hope in your life. (<i>JEFF AND ALYSSA BETHKE, authors of Jesus &gt; Religion and Spoken For</i>)<br><br>Rebekah is a sister who fights for the freedom of others. We talked in the early stages of her dreaming about this message and I told her, &#x201c;You have to write this.&#x201d; The anthem of freedom isn&#x2019;t for a distant future, but for here and now. This book declares, as long as there is a beat in our heart, we are called to be free. (<i>CHRISTINE CAINE, founder of Propel Women &amp; A21</i>)<br><br>The first time I met Rebekah, I left feeling nearer to Jesus, because I knew her intimacy with him could not be staged or put on. This book won&#x2019;t leave you with a to-do list or an ache in your soul to improve, but simply an invitation from someone who lives free. You'll be drawn to the foot of the cross, to worship outside the empty grave, and to embrace your freedom and the freedom of others. (<i>JESS CONNOLLY, founder of the Influence Network and Amen Paper Company and author of Wild and Free</i>)<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t but a few pages in and wanted to shout for joy because of the power of this message. Rebekah opens up her life with refreshing authenticity and a deep commitment to Scripture. She brilliantly points out that true freedom is found when God is enough in our lives and when he has become our all. You Are Free is a call for every believer to experience the strength of God in our weakness, the beauty of God in our ashes, and the confidence of God in our insecurities. (<i>BANNING LIEBSCHER, Jesus Culture founder and pastor</i>)<br><br>My favorite teachers teach from the trenches. Rebekah has done the work and fought for her own freedom and now is fighting for ours. I have seen my friend cry tears for your freedom. Prepare to enjoy being fought for by God through these words. (<i>JENNIE ALLEN, founder and visionary, IF:Gathering and author of Nothing to Prove</i>)<br><br>The freedom to be exactly who God created is something we all search for. With hope, beauty, and the expertise of a skillful guide, Rebekah takes us on a journey back to living each day in the joy of being our truest self. A truly remarkable book! (<i>MIKE FOSTER, author of People of the Second Chance: A Guide to Bringing Life-Saving Love to the World</i>)<br><br>Scripture boldly declares, 'It is for freedom that Christ has set us free,' and yet many of us cannot hear clearly, let alone enter into this truth amid the clutter of our distractions, anxieties, sorrows, fatigue, regrets, loneliness, shame, and other freedom-inhibiting realities. After reading this book in a single sitting, I felt more known, more forgiven, more loved, and more hopeful in Jesus.

Many of the stories don't quite fit either the standard ("Whodunit?") or inverted ("Howcatchem?") styles common to the mystery genre, and Father Brown is frequently less concerned with the apprehension of the wrongdoer than with getting him to understand, and admit, the error of his ways.<br><br> With his powers of observation and attention to details, and a knowledge of crime and criminals derived in no small part from his years as a priest hearing confessions, Father Brown frequently finds the solution through a strictly rational reasoning process more concerned with psychological, spiritual and philosophic truths than with scientific investigation.<br><br> This particular volume contains twelve of Chesterton's original Father Brown adventures, published as individual short stories in 1910 and 1911 and first collected and published in book form under the title <i>The Innocence of Father Brown</i> in 1911.<br><br> A second collection of Father Brown mysteries, <i>The Wisdom of Father Brown</i>, (ISBN-13: 978-1500632137; ISBN-10: 1500632139) first collected and published in 1914, is also available from Summit Classic Press in a matching large print edition.<br><br> <b><i>G.K.

Did you turn on a light? Did you think about how miraculous either one of those things is when you did it? Of course not--but you should, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Johnson has. This adaptation of his adult book and popular PBS series explores the fascinating and interconnected stories of innovations--like clean drinking water and electricity--that changed the way people live.</b><br><br>Innovation starts with a problem whose solution sets in motion all kinds of unexpected discoveries. That's why you can draw a line from pendulums to punching the clock at a factory, from ice blocks to summer movie blockbusters, from clean water to computer chips.<br><br>In the lively storytelling style that has made him a popular, bestselling author, Steven Johnson looks at how accidental genius, brilliant mistakes, and unintended consequences shape the way we live in the modern world. Johnson's "long zoom" approach connects history, geography, politics, and scientific advances with the deep curiousity of inventors or quirky interests of tinkerers to show how innovation truly comes about. <br><br>His fascinating account is organized into six topics: glass, cold, sound, clean, time, light. Johnson's fresh exploration of these simple, single-syllable word concepts creates an endlessly absorbing story that moves from lightning strikes in the prehistoric desert to the herculean effort to literally raise up the city of Chicago to laser labs straight out of a sci-fi movie. <br><br>In other words, it's the story of how we got to now!</p><p><b>Steven Johnson</b> is the bestselling author of eleven books, including <i>Where Good Ideas Come From</i>, <i>Wonderland</i>, and <i>The Ghost Map</i>.

Scientists trust that the results reported by others are valid. Society trusts that the results of research reflect an honest attempt by scientists to describe the world accurately and without bias. But this trust will endure only if the scientific community devotes itself to exemplifying and transmitting the values associated with ethical scientific conduct.<br> <br> <i>On Being a Scientist</i> was designed to supplement the informal lessons in ethics provided by research supervisors and mentors. The book describes the ethical foundations of scientific practices and some of the personal and professional issues that researchers encounter in their work. It applies to all forms of research--whether in academic, industrial, or governmental settings-and to all scientific disciplines.<br> <br> This third edition of <i>On Being a Scientist</i> reflects developments since the publication of the original edition in 1989 and a second edition in 1995. A continuing feature of this edition is the inclusion of a number of hypothetical scenarios offering guidance in thinking about and discussing these scenarios.<br> <br> <i>On Being a Scientist</i> is aimed primarily at graduate students and beginning researchers, but its lessons apply to all scientists at all stages of their scientific careers.<br> </p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research</li><li>Advising and Mentoring</li><li>The Treatment of Data</li><li>Mistakes and Negligence</li><li>Research Misconduct</li><li>Responding to Suspected Violations of Professional Standards</li><li>Human Participants and Animal Subjects in Research</li><li>Laboratory Safety in Research</li><li>Sharing of Research Results</li><li>Authorship and the Allocation of Credit</li><li>Intellectual Property</li><li>Competing Interests, Commitments, and Values</li><li>The Researcher in Society</li><li>Appendix: Discussion of Case Studies</li><li>Additional Resources</li></ul></p><p>Since the first edition of <b>On Being a Scientist</b> was published in 1988, more than 200,000 copies have been distributed to graduate and undergraduate science students.

But Paul &#x201c;Wolfie&#x201d; Sedgewick&#x2019;s fatal fall from the sheer cliffs near Going-To-the-Sun Road is incomprehensible. Wolfie was an experienced and highly regarded wildlife biologist who knew all too well the perils that Glacier&#x2019;s treacherous terrain presents&#x2014;and how to avoid them.<br> <br>The case, so close to home, has frayed park employee emotions. Yet calm and methodical lead investigator Monty senses in his gut that something isn&#x2019;t right. So when whispers of irresponsibility or suicide emerge, tarnishing Wolfie&#x2019;s reputation, Monty dedicates himself to uncovering the truth, for the sake of the man&#x2019;s family and to satisfy his own persistent sense of unease.<br> <br>Monty discovers that Wolfie&#x2019;s zealous studies of Glacier&#x2019;s mysterious, embattled wolverine population, so vital to park ecology, had met resistance, both local and federal. To muddy the waters further, a wilderness facility for rehabilitating troubled teens&#x2014;one that Monty&#x2019;s older brother attended&#x2014;may have a disturbing connection to the case. As Monty delves further into an investigation that goes deeper than he ever imagined, he wrestles with the demons of his past, which lead back to harsh betrayals he thought he&#x2019;d buried long ago.<br> <br>And then a second body is found.</p><p>Christine Carbo is the author of <i>The Wild Inside, Mortal Fall, </i>and <i>The Weight of Night. </i>A Florida native, she and her family live in Whitefish, Montana.

When I possess facts, I can clear the detritus around me, think straight, and proceed cautiously. Some might argue that this response is an overreaction to a complicated upbringing, or an overzealous affection for order; and in fact, that might be true. So when my intuition niggled at me that something wasn&#x2019;t quite right with this particular accident, I tried to ignore it. The facts are that every summer in Glacier Park, there is at least one if not several hikers or climbers who stumble on unstable rock or lose their balance on wet, slippery boulders, sliding wildly out of control and catapulting to their demise on the jagged terrain below or into a raging stream, whisking them away.<br> <br>All of us Glacier Park Police officers and rangers know that the most dire situations are frequently born from small, seemingly insignificant errors of judgment where a hiker is impatient, for example, and thinks the shortcut across an early-season snowfield is a stellar idea. So this tragedy was no different other than the fact that the Loop&#x2014;the hairpin curve on the west side of Going-to-the-Sun Road&#x2014;was an odd place for a hiker to go down. Although incredibly steep in places close to the pass, it was, after all, near the main road and a small buildup of natural stone formed a roadside barrier at the curving, sheer edge.<br> <br>I stood with Ken Greeley, another Park Police officer, Charlie Olson, one of our seasoned rangers, and Joe Smith, chief of Park Police, on the short rock divider with Heavens Peak to our left. Nearly nine thousand feet of mass pushed to the sky and dominated the view west from the Going-to-the-Sun Road. Scraps of clouds reached northward from the permanently snow-coated peak like silk pennons.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like a bad fall.&#x201d; Ken chewed a piece of gum vigorously as he peered down at the foot and leg twisted at an unnatural angle. &#x201c;Any chance he hiked in from a different route and is still alive?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unlikely,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t moved since Charlie reported it. But I&#x2019;ve got S&amp;R on standby.&#x201d;<br> <br>We had gotten word an hour before from Charlie. A tourist had spotted something white poking out from a dark shadow in the steep ravine, found Charlie talking to some folks near the outdoor bathroom facility, and asked him to take a look. Although difficult to make out details with the tricks shadows like to play on rocks, Charlie did agree&#x2014;with the help of some binoculars&#x2014;that it appeared to be a shoe, a light-colored sock, and an ankle illuminated by a bright strip of sunshine piercing the crevasse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Think maybe it was a suicide?&#x201d; Ken asked.<br> <br>Joe shrugged. He&#x2019;d been particularly quiet for the past eight months since the well-known case dubbed Bear Bait, in which we&#x2019;d found a man bound to a tree near McGhee Meadow in Glacier Park. The victim, Victor Lance, was killed and fed on by a grizzly, and one of Joe&#x2019;s family members had been involved. I&#x2019;d assisted a lead investigator from the Department of the Interior on the case.<br> <br>&#x201c;Possibly,&#x201d; I offered on Joe&#x2019;s behalf. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell for sure, but from the looks of where he is, I don&#x2019;t think he actually fell from this roadside after all. There&#x2019;s some slippery rock.&#x201d; I pointed my chin to a spring seep that coated part of the slope across from us. The June sun spread across my back like the hot palm of a hand. Summer often arrives late to these parts, the fresh tang of spring sometimes hanging on until past solstice, but today seemed to mark the season&#x2019;s first solid lunge forward. It was going on eleven a.m., and Glacier Park vibrated with new life and promise. Here today, gone tomorrow, I thought morosely. &#x201c;He might have gone off trail to take a picture or a piss and misjudged how slippery those rocks are when they&#x2019;re wet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Joe said, then sighed and looked at me. &#x201c;Monty&#x201d;&#x2014;his voice sounded tired and the brim of his cap shadowed his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;you&#x2019;ll handle the investigation. And you&#x201d;&#x2014;he turned to Ken&#x2014;&#x201c;will assist. Once you&#x2019;re down there, I&#x2019;ll need you to assess the scene. Like I said, if he&#x2019;s still alive, we&#x2019;ve got Rescue ready to go.&#x201d; Then he turned to Charlie. &#x201c;You and I will secure the area and begin directing traffic. When the victim&#x2019;s ready to be removed,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a short-haul team on standby. Looks too steep and rocky to haul him up without the chopper and we&#x2019;ll need to close the road for a while. Tourists are going to get way backed up today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Twenty-five minutes later, Ken and I had our anchors set and we were ready to gingerly rappel over the edge, down two hundred vertical feet into the shadowy ravine. Two other experienced rangers, Karen Fortenson and Michael Bridwell, were brought in to man the anchors and assist with the ropes from above so that the weight was transferred appropriately through the pulley system. Each full-time park ranger and all Park Police officers are trained in basic emergency medical service, including Search and Rescue and rope rescue, but some have more experience than others. I was glad to be with Ken who I knew had been on a fair share of rope rescues in the past few years.<br> <br>In addition to some on-the-job training, I had been scaling mountains since high school. I joined a local hiking and rock-climbing group in Columbia Falls, my small hometown located at the mouth of the canyon leading to Glacier Park. I had seen a flyer for the group on a bulletin board at a grocery store and called because I wasn&#x2019;t the type to mope around at home after completing my schoolwork. Since it was just getting started and had only a few members&#x2014;a few mellow twentysomethings&#x2014;they welcomed me, even though I was only a teen.<br> <br>I spent many weekends roaming the surrounding mountains of the Flathead Valley with the guys in the group, who asked me very few questions and basically treated me with respect, something I wasn&#x2019;t used to from my own father or brother. They taught me what they knew about backcountry hiking, camping, rock climbing, and rappelling. I loved the notion that I could challenge myself by moving through untamed places that forced me to handle myself and my emotions on a grander scale. And, Jesus, to simply escape! To leave the house for hours to cleanse the mind under an endless sky, to be away from where the air always seemed thick and the ceiling heavy.<br> <br>With a hard hat on and the sit harness around my legs and waist, I walked backwards out and away from the cliff where Ken and others stood. I controlled the brake with my right hand and descended slowly, keeping my feet close to the cliff until I made it down into the ravine.<br> <br>I removed the carabiners from my harness and watched Ken make his descent. He was a large, muscular guy with almost no neck, a shaved, shiny head, and shoulders perpetually raised toward his ears with the bulk of his muscles. I was the opposite: lean and just shy of five foot nine, thick hair with graying sideburns that contradicted that I was only thirty-four, and dark, determined eyes that looked like I trusted everyone, but rarely took no for an answer. When Ken reached the ground, we hiked over cool, shadowed rocks and through brush.<br> <br>A few yards from the victim, I stopped, took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes. I could feel my own heart thumping in my chest. The surprise and shock I felt from seeing the damage inflicted upon bone and flesh from smashing into rocks, the violation of our everyday perception of the human body, was something I never could get used to. I held out my hand for Ken to halt as well, then I let out a low, soft whistle.<br> <br>I put my glasses back on and took in the scene. It felt suddenly quiet and intimate, as if the breeze had quit rattling the leaves, the hawks had gone silent, and McDonald Creek below us had ceased to roar from its full flow of spring runoff. But I knew none of this had happened; it was just an effect of my shocked senses in spite of how many times I&#x2019;d seen it before: five to be exact. Three climbing incidents on the popular climbing peaks at the top of the pass, one fall into McDonald Creek, and one hiking accident in which the man had slid down a snowfield and off an abrupt ledge.<br> <br>Before us, blood had stained the rocks around the back of the victim&#x2019;s head. His skull was flattened, broken open like an egg with cerebrospinal fluid, gray brain matter, and blood drained out onto the rocky ground. His face was crushed, torn, swollen, and unrecognizable, but I could see what looked like facial hair streaked with blood and dirt. Every single limb lay twisted in awkward and unnatural angles, badly gashed and coated with dried blood. He had hit rock probably several times on the way down, using his hands instinctively to try to break the first slam. His hands and wrists were shattered up to his elbows, one thumb completely ripped off. The other arm lay hidden and abnormally cocked under his back with his shoulder joint dislocated. He looked like a badly broken Ken doll.<br> <br>There was something familiar about the illogically crooked, disfigured body and at the same time, nothing at all recognizable. The man had long, dirty-blond and curly locks, also marbled with dirt and caked blood that had turned the color of rust. He had on army-green shorts and a tattered T-shirt that looked like it might have been white or yellow, but it was torn, covered in grime and body fluids and was hard to tell. One foot missed its hiking shoe, which had probably popped off on impact and been cast into some bushes even farther below.<br> <br>I could hear tiny insects buzzing and zigzagging. Small blowflies had already swarmed into the mucus in his eye sockets, his mouth, and other wounds. My mouth went dry, then began to water. He smelled of death, a copper odor mixed with beef gone bad. I ignored the queasy sensation in my gut and pulled some nitrile and vinyl gloves out of my pocket, put them on, and walked to him. The instinct is to offer comforting words as if the person was still alive, to say, Are you okay? Help is on the way, but I shook the urge away and knelt beside him. Still grasping for the ordinary, I began to reach out with my two fingers toward his neck to check his vitals, then stopped. Checking for a pulse was as futile as trying to console him. It was obvious his neck was broken, his skull lacerated, and the life gone out of his one partially open eye, already gone opaque. The other was swollen shut. I withdrew my hand and shook my head to Ken.<br> <br>Ken didn&#x2019;t say anything. I could hear him breathing&#x2014;strong exhales through his nostrils and he had ceased smacking his gum. He was usually hard to keep quiet and was not acting like his chatty and eager self. I chalked it up to the task at hand.<br> <br>I grabbed my radio and pressed Talk. &#x201c;Chief, you read?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep, please report.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deceased. Judging by the color of the blood and his eyes, looks like he&#x2019;s been here at least since yesterday. Rigor mortis has set in as well and it doesn&#x2019;t appear to have begun to wear off. Doesn&#x2019;t appear to be chewed on though, so no animals have been around yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bonus,&#x201d; Joe said, and I could hear him sigh like he didn&#x2019;t want to be doing this so early into tourist season, which really fires up around the Fourth of July.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll look around, take notes and photos,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you know when we&#x2019;re getting closer to being done down here.&#x201d;<br> <br>We signed off, and l looked up at the clear cloudless sky. &#x201c;Since he&#x2019;s not alive,&#x201d; I said to Ken, &#x201c;and no rain in the forecast, there&#x2019;s no major rush in getting him up. Let&#x2019;s study the area as carefully as we can.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ken took out a tissue from his pocket and plucked his gum out with his thumb and forefinger. He briefly looked at it with disgust, then wrapped it in the tissue and placed it back in his pocket. I didn&#x2019;t bother to tell him he&#x2019;d be better off continuing to chew it or to grab a new piece because it helped minimize the full onslaught of death&#x2019;s odor. I wasn&#x2019;t much older than Ken, but I had gone through some recent forensics schooling while he&#x2019;d had very little, just the initial training program&#x2014;stuff like criminal investigations, park and recreation law, criminal procedure, and penal law. I was certain Ken had only been on one or two death scenes before, and only as a bystander, although he&#x2019;d been on plenty of Search and Rescue missions. Fortunately, I had recently spent hours in Georgia going over forensic analysis with a cadaver before me.<br> <br>After my time with Department of Interior agent Ted Systead on Bear Bait, I&#x2019;d decided I wanted to enhance my knowledge of investigative services. I&#x2019;d always been a fully-trained, permanent full-time law enforcement officer since I&#x2019;d been employed by the park, but since I&#x2019;m a good organizer and notetaker, I&#x2019;d been pulled into administrative duties with the super. And before becoming a Park Police officer, I was a game warden in eastern Montana close to the Divide.<br> <br>But I hadn&#x2019;t been on a crime case in a long time until the Bear Bait case popped up. After it, my hunger to be involved in investigative services deepened, and I&#x2019;m sure it was no coincidence that my desire to plunge into something wholly absorbing coincided with being separated from my wife, Lara. I admit I have a propensity for a bit of tunnel vision, for working feverishly on things that catch my interest. Lara would tell you that it was a problem at times&#x2014;how I could tune out our lives and escape into the pull of a new task. I&#x2019;ve been this way for as long as I can remember.<br> <br>So once I caught the investigative bug, I no longer wanted any part of the administrative duties I&#x2019;d been mixed up in for the past few years. I asked Joe, and he agreed to send me to a refresher course in Brunswick, Georgia, on Crime Scene Investigative Procedures, Evidence Collection and Analysis, and another on Modern Forensics.<br> <br>I removed my pack and pulled out another pair of gloves for Ken, some evidence markers, and my notepad while he grabbed the camera.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here we go,&#x201d; I said, ready to put my recent training to work. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see if I can do this without taking forever.&#x201d; I kneeled down again by the body and pressed my forefinger into the blotched and bluish-purple skin of his arm. The skin was cold, still in the shadows and, of course, the algor mortis&#x2014;the death chill&#x2014;well underway. The flesh stayed purple. I noted that and said to Ken, &#x201c;Looks like hypostasis has spread evenly and isn&#x2019;t responding to pressure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Ken mumbled.<br> <br>&#x201c;The discoloring of the skin&#x2014;you know, the livor mortis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Ken said. He looked away, to the cliffs above us. A hawk sailed by.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably means he&#x2019;s been out here for more than ten to twelve hours,&#x201d; I offered. &#x201c;After five or six, the lividity blotches start to merge, but the skin still goes white when pressed. After ten, give or take depending on temperature, it stays this bluish-purple color. And,&#x201d; I noted, &#x201c;rigor mortis hasn&#x2019;t yet begun to wear off as it does about thirty-six hours after death. Although with the cold last night,&#x201d; I reconsidered, &#x201c;what was it? Maybe forty-five, forty-eight degrees?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2019;Bout that,&#x201d; Ken agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Might&#x2019;ve slowed both processes down quite a bit. The coroner or pathologist should be able to tell us more, depending on how far this goes.&#x201d; Often with accidents like these, an autopsy is done regardless&#x2014;just to be thorough because with a fall, it&#x2019;s always harder to know if foul play occurred.

Her husband and longtime collaborator Victor has translated and transcribed these vignettes on how to buy and what to do with the fresh produce used in Italian cooking, the elements of an essential pantry, and salumi.<br> <br>Before you know how to cook, you must know how to shop. From Artichokes to Zucchini, Anchovies to Ziti, <i>Ingredienti</i> offers succinct and compelling advice on how to choose vegetables, pasta, olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano, prosciutto, and all of the key elements of Marcella&#x2019;s classic meals. Organic isn&#x2019;t necessarily best, boxed pasta can be better than fresh. Marcella&#x2019;s authoritative wisdom and surprising tips will change the way you cook. Her clear, practical guidance in acquiring the components of good cooking is helpful wherever you choose to shop&#x2014;in supermarkets, farmers&#x2019; markets, specialty food stores, or online.<br> <br>Based on sixty years of almost daily visits to the market to choose the ingredients of that day&#x2019;s meal, <i>Ingredienti</i> is a life&#x2019;s work, distilled&#x2014;an expression of Marcella&#x2019;s judgments, advice, and suggestions. Uncomplicated and precise, this volume will be essential to home cooks eager to produce meals in the same delicious style Marcella was the first to introduce to America.</p><p>Marcella Hazan (1924-2013) was born in Cesenatico, a fishing village on the northern Adriatic shore of Italy. She studied for a career in the sciences and received two doctoral degrees from the University of Ferrara in Emilia-Romagna. In 1955 she married Victor Hazan, an Italian-born American, and moved with him to New York, where she began teaching Italian cooking classes in her apartment. In 1973 she published her first cookbook, <i>The Classic Italian Cook Book</i>, which introduced Americans to authentic Italian food. Her cooking schools in Italy draw students from around the world. Hazan was the recipient of two Lifetime Achievement Awards (from the James Beard Foundation in 2000, and the IACP in 2004) and a knighthood from her own country. She was the author of five additional classic cookbooks and a memoir.<br><br>Victor Hazan, Marcella&#x2019;s lifelong collaborator and writing partner, is an authority on Italian wine and food. He is the author of <i>Italian Wine</i>. He lives in Longboat Key, Florida."Much is said about using the very best ingredients to make the very best food, but few can boast having the undisputed queen&#x2019;s voice in their head when shopping or preparing a dish... Marcella&#x2019;s blues-singer voice is as clear in this indispensable tome as it was when we shared lunches over the years. Her wit, her supreme and hilarious sarcasm and most of all her complete confidence in choosing the precise and exact best ingredients from the infinite number of things available to the modern cook make this book the perfect handbook to carry shopping everywhere and anywhere."

The simple yet memorable eloquence of his speeches, proclamations and personal correspondence is recorded here in a representative collection of 16 documents.<br>This volume contains, complete and unabridged, the Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois (1838), which emphasized a theme Lincoln was to return to repeatedly, namely, the capacity of a people to govern themselves; the "House Divided" speech at the Republican State Convention in Illinois (1858); the First Inaugural Address (1861), in which he appealed to the people of an already divided union for sectional harmony; the Gettysburg Address (1863), a speech delivered at ceremonies dedicating a part of the Gettysburg battlefield as a cemetery; the Letter to Mrs. Bixby (1864), expressing Lincoln's regrets over the wartime deaths of her five sons; the Second Inaugural Address (March 1865), urging a post-war nation to "bind up its wounds" and show "charity for all"; and his Last Public Address (April 11, 1865). New notes place the speeches and other documents in their respective historical contexts.<br>An invaluable reference for history students, this important volume will also fascinate admirers of Abraham Lincoln, Americana enthusiasts, Civil War buffs and any lover of the finely crafted phrase.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln (1809&#x2013;1865) was the sixteenth president of the United States. He led the United States through the Civil War, issued the Emancipation Proclamation, and promoted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery. <br> <br>Alan Sklar is the winner of several <i>AudioFile</i> Earphones Awards and a multiple finalist for the APA's prestigious Audie Award.

Here, too, are Mayle's latest tips on where to find the best honey, cheese, or <i>chambre d'h�te</i> the region has to offer. Lyric, insightful, sparkling with detail, <i>Encore Provence</i> brings us a land where the smell of thyme in the fields or the glory of a leisurely lunch is no less than inspiring.</p><p>"Provence, again?" one may think, seeing Peter Mayle's latest effort. "Has the man nothing better to do than promote a region that's already overhyped and overpriced? Can't he turn his eye to a place that needs a touristic boost, like Bulgaria?"<p> However, there are reasons to plunge into the third Proven�al book by Englishman Mayle, formerly a Madison Avenue copywriter whose bestselling <i>A Year in Provence</i> made the area a must-see for tourists and helped to quadruple real estate prices there. After four years in Long Island, Mayle has returned to France with continuing adoration.</p><p> Mayle discloses a world missed by tourists, be it the questions dry cleaners ask about wine stains or the mysterious murder of a small-town butcher given to making housewives happy with more than his displayed meat. He also incorporates guide-like tips--listing markets, cheese makers, and the essential how-tos of perfume sniffing and olive-oil tasting. What's more, this book gives a peek into the life of a bestselling writer. The role is not always an enviable one.</p><p> Mayle no longer fits into life in America--the vocabulary alone is enough to throw him off--yet in Provence, he is regarded as little more than a moneyed foreigner. Speared by the British press, he laments, "One of my crimes is to have encouraged people to visit the region ... far too many people ... and people of the wrong sort," an accusation that he denies.</p><p> And Mayle comes off as positively defensive in his attack of former <i>New York Times</i> food critic Ruth Reichl, who wrote that she was disappointed in the region. The title alone of chapter 3 hints at the sarcastic stabbings to follow: "<i>New York Times</i> Restaurant Critic Makes Astonishing Discovery: Provence Never Existed." Page after page, he roasts Reichl on the spit, creating a hissing Ruth Rotisserie that's most unbecoming from someone of his stature. </p><p> What most causes him to sputter is Reichl's admission that she "had been dreaming of a Provence that never existed."</p><p> "Where had I been living all these years?" writes the man who's helped to perpetrate the illusion of a land that is nothing but lavender fields, sunflowers swaying in the breeze, and fascinating characters every millimeter. "The Provence that Daudet, Giono, Ford Madox Ford, Lawrence Durrell and M.F.K. Fisher knew and wrote about--the Provence that I know--doesn't exist.... It's a sunny figment of our imagination, a romanticized fantasy."</p><p> Maybe. Having recently visited Provence, I agree with Reichl's critical assessment. Therein lies Mayle's ultimate charm. Crack open a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape, delve into <i>Encore Provence</i>, and voil�: it may be better than actually being there. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"[Peter Mayle] is something of a wonder. . .chronicling the scene around him in irresistible prose, the joys of a bountiful climate, brilliant sun, and a splendid cuisine." --<i>Time</i><br><br>"Grab a Pastis and settle in for a scintillating rendezvous. Mayle's insights have never been more thoughtful."<p>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"Delightful, amusing, and appealing."</p><p>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Mayle's prose is, as ever, as pure and welcoming as a glass of the house wine at a Proven�al cafe." --<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p></p><h2>DKfindout!

Matekoni, that great mechanic, and good man. No car . . .<br><br>He paused. It was necessary, he felt, to order the mind when one was about to think something profound. And Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni was at that moment on the verge of an exceptionally important thought, even though its final shape had yet to reveal itself. How much easier it was for Mma Ramotswe&#x2014;she put things so well, so succinctly, so profoundly, and appeared to do this with such little effort. It was very different if one was a mechanic, and therefore not used to telling people&#x2014;in the nicest possible way, of course&#x2014;how to run their lives. Then one had to think quite hard to find just the right words that would make people sit up and say, &#x201c;But that is very true, Rra!&#x201d; Or, especially if you were Mma Ramotswe, &#x201c;But surely that is well known!&#x201d;<br><br>He had very few criticisms to make of Precious Ramotswe, his wife and founder of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency, but if one were to make a list of her faults&#x2014;which would be a minuscule document, barely visible, indeed, to the naked eye&#x2014;one would perhaps have to include a tendency (only a slight tendency, of course) to claim that things that she happened to believe were well known. This phrase gave these beliefs a sort of unassailable authority, the status that went with facts that all right-thinking people would readily acknowledge&#x2014;such as the fact that the sun rose in the east, over the undulating canopy of acacia that stretched along Botswana&#x2019;s border, over the waters of the great Limpopo River itself that now, at the height of the rainy season, flowed deep and fast towards the ocean half a continent away. Or the fact that Seretse Khama had been the first President of Botswana; or even the truism that Botswana was one of the finest and most peaceful countries in the world. All of these facts were indeed both incontestable and well known; whereas Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s pronouncements, to which she attributed the special status of being well known, were often, rather, statements of opinion. There was a difference, thought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, but it was not one he was planning to point out; there were some things, after all, that it was not <i>helpful</i> for a husband to say to his wife and that, he thought, was probably one of them.<br><br>Now, his thoughts having been properly marshalled, the right words came to him in a neat, economical expression: <i>No car is entirely perfect</i>. That was what he wanted to say, and these words were all that was needed to say it. So he said it once more. <i>No car is entirely perfect.</i><br><br>In his experience, which was considerable&#x2014;as the proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and attending physician, therefore, to a whole fleet of middle-ranking cars&#x2014;every vehicle had its bad points, its foibles, its rattles, its complaints; and this, he thought, was the language of machinery, those idiosyncratic engine sounds by which a car would strive to communicate with those with ears to listen, usually mechanics. Every car had its good points too: a comfortable driving seat, perhaps, moulded over the years to the shape of the car&#x2019;s owner, or an engine that started the first time without hesitation or complaint, even on the coldest winter morning, when the air above Botswana was dry and crisp and sharp in the lungs. Each car, then, was an individual, and if only he could get his apprentices to grasp that fact, their work might be a little bit more reliable and less prone to require redoing by him. <i>Push, shove, twist</i>: these were no mantras for a good mechanic. <i>Listen, coax, soothe</i>: that should be the motto inscribed above the entrance to every garage; that, or the words which he had once seen printed on the advertisement for a garage in Francistown: <i>Your car is ours.</i><br><br>That slogan, persuasive though it might have sounded, had given him pause. It was a little ambiguous, he decided: on the one hand, it might be taken to suggest that the garage was in the business of taking people&#x2019;s cars away from them&#x2014;an unfortunate choice of words if read that way. On the other, it could mean that the garage staff treated clients&#x2019; cars with the same care that they treated their own. That, he thought, is what they meant, and it would have been preferable if they had said it. <i>It is always better to say what you mean</i>&#x2014;it was his wife, Mma Ramotswe, who said that, and he had always assumed that she meant it.<br><br>No, he mused: there is no such thing as a perfect car, and if every car had its good and bad points, it was the same with people. Just as every person had his or her little ways&#x2014;habits that niggled or irritated others, annoying mannerisms, vices and failings, moments of selfishness&#x2014;so too did they have their good points: a winning smile, an infectious sense of humour, the ability to cook a favourite dish just the way you wanted it.<br><br>That was the way the world was; it was composed of a few almost perfect people (ourselves); then there were a good many people who generally did their best but were not all that perfect (our friends and colleagues); and finally, there were a few rather nasty ones (our enemies and opponents). Most people fell into that middle group&#x2014;those who did their best&#x2014;and the last group was, thankfully, very small and not much in evidence in places like Botswana, where he was fortunate enough to live.<br><br>These reflections came to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni while he was driving his tow-truck down the Lobatse Road. He was on what Mma Ramotswe described as one of his errands of mercy. In this case he was setting out to rescue the car of one Mma Constance Mateleke, a senior and highly regarded midwife and, as it happened, a long-standing friend of Mma Ramotswe. She had called him from the roadside. &#x201c;Quite dead,&#x201d; said Mma Mateleke through the faint, crackling line of her mobile phone. &#x201c;Stopped. Plenty of petrol. Just stopped like that, Mr. Matekoni. Dead.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni smiled to himself. &#x201c;No car dies for ever,&#x201d; he consoled her. &#x201c;When a car <i>seems</i> to die, it is sometimes just sleeping. Like Lazarus, you know.&#x201d; He was not quite sure of the analogy. As a boy he had heard the story of Lazarus at Sunday School in Molepolole, but his recollection was now hazy. It was many years ago, and the stories of that time, the real, the made-up, the long-winded tales of the old people&#x2014;all of these had a tendency to get mixed up and become one. There were seven lean cows in somebody&#x2019;s dream, or was it five lean cows and seven fat ones?<br><br>&#x201c;So you are calling yourself Jesus Christ now, are you, Mr. Matekoni? No more Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, is it? Jesus Christ Motors now?&#x201d; retorted Mma Mateleke. &#x201c;You say that you can raise cars from the dead. Is that what you&#x2019;re saying?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni chuckled. &#x201c;Certainly not. No, I am just a mechanic, but I know how to wake cars up. That is not a special thing. Any mechanic can wake a car.&#x201d; Not apprentices, though, he thought.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have great faith in you, Mr. Matekoni, but this car seems very sick now. And time is running away. Perhaps we should stop talking on the phone and you should be getting into your truck to come and help me.&#x201d;<br><br>So it was that he came to be travelling down the Lobatse Road, on a pleasantly fresh morning, allowing his thoughts to wander on the broad subject of perfection and flaws. On either side of the road the country rolled out in a grey-green carpet of thorn bush, stretching off into the distance, to where the rocky outcrops of the hills marked the end of the land and the beginning of the sky. The rains had brought thick new grass sprouting up between the trees; this was good, as the cattle would soon become fat on the abundant sweet forage it provided. And it was good for Botswana too, as fat cattle meant fat people&#x2014;not too fat, of course, but well-fed and prosperous-looking; people who were happy to be who they were and where they were.<br><br>Yes, thought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, even if no country was absolutely perfect, Botswana, surely, came as close as one could get. He closed his eyes in contentment, and then quickly remembered that he was driving, and opened them again. A car behind him&#x2014;not a car that he recognised&#x2014;had driven to within a few feet of the rear of his tow-truck, and was aggressively looking for an opportunity to pass. The problem, though, was that the Lobatse Road was busy with traffic coming the other way, and there was a vehicle in front of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni that was in no hurry to get anywhere; it was a driver like Mma Potokwane, he imagined, who ambled along and frequently knocked the gear-stick out of gear as she waved her hand to emphasise some point she was making to a passenger. Yet Mma Potokwane, and this slow driver ahead of him, he reminded himself, had a right to take things gently if they wished. Lobatse would not go away, and whether one reached it at eleven in the morning or half past eleven would surely matter very little.<br><br>He looked in his rear-view mirror. He could not make out the face of the driver, who was sitting well back in his seat, and he could not therefore engage in eye contact with him. He should calm down, thought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, rather than . . . His line of thought was interrupted by the sudden swerving of the other vehicle as it pulled over sharply to the left. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, well versed as he was in the ways of every sort of driver, gripped his steering wheel hard and muttered under his breath. What was being attempted was that most dangerous of manoeuvres&#x2014;overtaking on the wrong side.<br><br>He steered a steady course, carefully applying his brakes so as to allow the other driver ample opportunity to effect his passing as quickly as possible. Not that he deserved the consideration, of course, but Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni knew that when another driver did something dangerous it was best to allow him to finish what he was doing and get out of the way.<br><br>In a cloud of dust and gravel chips thrown up off the unpaved verge of the road, the impatient car shot past, before swerving again to get back onto the tarmac. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni felt the urge to lean on his horn and flash his lights in anger, but he did neither of these things. The other driver knew that what he had done was wrong; there was no need to engage in an abusive exchange which would lead nowhere, and would certainly not change that driver&#x2019;s ways. &#x201c;You do not change people by shouting at them,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe had once observed. And she was right: sounding one&#x2019;s horn, shouting&#x2014;these were much the same things, and achieved equally little.<br><br>And then an extraordinary thing happened. The impatient driver, his illegal manoeuvre over, and now clear of the tow-truck, looked in his mirror and gave a scrupulously polite thank-you wave to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. And Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, taken by surprise, responded with an equally polite wave of acknowledgement, as one would reply to any roadside courtesy or show of good driving manners. That was the curious thing about Botswana; even when people were rude&#x2014;and some degree of human rudeness was inevitable&#x2014;they were rude in a fairly polite way.</p><h2>The Road From Home: A True Story of Courage, Survival and Hope</h2><p><p>David Kherdian re-creates his mother's voice in telling the true story of a childhood interrupted by one of the most devastating holocausts of our century.

No other volume offers more convenient or more reliable access to Galileo's own words, whether on the telescope, the Dialogue, the trial, or the mature theory of motion. --Michael H. Shank, Professor of the History of Science, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</p><p>Maurice A. Finocchiaro is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Edited and translated by Maurice A. Finocchiaro, an international authority on Galileo, this collection makes available to scholars and students an excellent and extensive selection of Galileo's key works from his early career to the end of his life--some in toto and some represented by key selections. It presents not only Galileo's most famous works but also a range of less-known texts as well as an excellent selection of the documents from the trial of 1633 and from the 1616 condemnation of Copernicus. In addition to the breadth and quality of the selections, this volume is particularly attractive to students and instructors thanks to Finocchiaro's expert and up-to-date introductions, biographical sketch, chronology, annotated bibliography, and glossary. This is a must for anyone teaching or studying Galileo, the scientific revolution, and the relationship between science and religion. --Mario Biagioli, Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University<br><br>This skillful selection from Galileo's writings has something of the adventure story about it, as Galileo explores the skies in a way no one had done before and propounds a radical reorganization of the cosmos in consequence, defends himself from the accusation by the Church that his view contravenes Scripture but is condemned and forced to abjure, and returns finally in old age to publish a work that will not only set mechanics on a new path but will transform the very way in which the deeper knowledge of nature is to be found. Strongly recommended. --Ernan McMullin, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"This book works very well for an undergraduate audience. I also appreciated the fact that Finocchiaro kept his comments on Galileo's texts to a minimum to allow students to interact with the primary documents on their own terms. The introduction to the text also worked well; providing important information without being overbearing for the students. I will definitely continue to use this work in the future." --Nahyan Fancy, Depauw University</p><h2>Showdown at Yellow Butte: A Novel</h2><p>Tom Kedrick earned his stripes during the Civil War, fought Apaches, and even soldiered overseas.

M.O.B. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Thomas Jefferson&#39;s Qur&#39;an: Islam and the Founders</h2><p><p>In this original and illuminating book, Denise A. Spellberg reveals a little-known but crucial dimension of the story of American religious freedom&#x2014;a drama in which Islam played a surprising role. In 1765, eleven years before composing the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson bought a Qur&#x2019;an. This marked only the beginning of his lifelong interest in Islam, and he would go on to acquire numerous books on Middle Eastern languages, history, and travel, taking extensive notes on Islam as it relates to English common law. Jefferson sought to understand Islam notwithstanding his personal disdain for the faith, a sentiment prevalent among his Protestant contemporaries in England and America. But unlike most of them, by 1776 Jefferson could imagine Muslims as future citizens of his new country. <br><br>Based on groundbreaking research, Spellberg compellingly recounts how a handful of the Founders, Jefferson foremost among them, drew upon Enlightenment ideas about the toleration of Muslims (then deemed the ultimate outsiders in Western society) to fashion out of what had been a purely speculative debate a practical foundation for governance in America. In this way, Muslims, who were not even known to exist in the colonies, became the imaginary outer limit for an unprecedented, uniquely American religious pluralism that would also encompass the actual despised minorities of Jews and Catholics. The rancorous public dispute concerning the inclusion of Muslims, for which principle Jefferson&#x2019;s political foes would vilify him to the end of his life, thus became decisive in the Founders&#x2019; ultimate judgment not to establish a Protestant nation, as they might well have done. <br><br>As popular suspicions about Islam persist and the numbers of American Muslim citizenry grow into the millions, Spellberg&#x2019;s revelatory understanding of this radical notion of the Founders is more urgent than ever. <i>Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Qur&#x2019;an</i> is a timely look at the ideals that existed at our country&#x2019;s creation, and their fundamental implications for our present and future.</p></p><p><p>Denise A. Spellberg is an associate professor of history and Middle Eastern studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where she teaches courses on Islamic civilization and Islam in Europe and America.</p><p>Introduction<br><br> Imagining the Muslim as Citizen at the Founding of the United States<br> &nbsp;<br> [He] sais &#x201c;neither Pagan nor Mahamedan [Muslim] nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth because of his religion.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Thomas Jefferson, quoting John Locke, 1776<br> &nbsp;<br> At a time when most Americans were uninformed, misinformed, or simply afraid of Islam, Thomas Jefferson imagined Muslims as future citizens of his new nation. His engagement with the faith began with the purchase of a Qur&#x2019;an eleven years before he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson&#x2019;s Qur&#x2019;an survives still in the Library of Congress, serving as a symbol of his and early America&#x2019;s complex relation- ship with Islam and its adherents. That relationship remains of signal importance to this day.<br> &nbsp;<br> That he owned a Qur&#x2019;an reveals Jefferson&#x2019;s interest in the Islamic religion, but it does not explain his support for the rights of Muslims. Jefferson first read about Muslim &#x201c;civil rights&#x201d; in the work of one of his intellectual heroes: the seventeenth-century English philosopher John Locke. Locke had advocated the toleration of Muslims&#x2014;and Jews&#x2014; following in the footsteps of a few others in Europe who had considered the matter for more than a century before him. Jefferson&#x2019;s ideas about Muslim rights must be understood within this older context, a complex set of transatlantic ideas that would continue to evolve most markedly from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amid the interdenominational Christian violence in Europe, some Christians, beginning in the sixteenth century, chose Muslims as the test case for the demarcation of the theoretical boundaries of their toleration for all believers. Because of these European precedents, Muslims also became a part of American debates about religion and the limits of citizenship. As they set about creating a new government in the United States, the American Founders, Protestants all, frequently referred to the adherents of Islam as they contemplated the proper scope of religious freedom and individual rights among the nation&#x2019;s present and potential inhabitants. The founding generation debated whether the United States should be exclusively Protestant or a religiously plural polity. And if the latter, whether political equality&#x2014;the full rights of citizenship, including access to the highest office&#x2014;should extend to non-Protestants. The mention, then, of Muslims as potential citizens of the United States forced the Protestant majority to imagine the parameters of their new society beyond toleration. It obliged them to interrogate the nature of religious freedom: the issue of a &#x201c;religious test&#x201d; in the Constitution, like the ones that would exist at the state level into the nineteenth century; the question of &#x201c;an establishment of religion,&#x201d; potentially of Protestant Christianity; and the meaning and extent of a separation of religion from government.<br> &nbsp;<br> Resistance to the idea of Muslim citizenship was predictable in the eighteenth century. Americans had inherited from Europe almost a millennium of negative distortions of the faith&#x2019;s theological and political character. Given the dominance and popularity of these anti-Islamic representations, it was startling that a few notable Americans not only refused to exclude Muslims, but even imagined a day when they would be citizens of the United States, with full and equal rights. This surprising, uniquely American egalitarian defense of Muslim rights was the logical extension of European precedents already mentioned. Still, on both sides of the Atlantic, such ideas were marginal at best. How, then, did the idea of the Muslim as a citizen with rights survive despite powerful opposition from the outset? And what is the fate of that ideal in the twenty-first century?<br> &nbsp;<br> This book provides a new history of the founding era, one that explains how and why Thomas Jefferson and a handful of others adopted and then moved beyond European ideas about the toleration of Muslims. It should be said at the outset that these exceptional men were not motivated by any inherent appreciation for Islam as a religion. Muslims, for most American Protestants, remained beyond the outer limit of those possessing acceptable beliefs, but they nevertheless became emblems of two competing conceptions of the nation&#x2019;s identity: one essentially preserving the Protestant status quo, and the other fully realizing the pluralism implied in the Revolutionary rhetoric of inalienable and universal rights. Thus while some fought to exclude a group whose inclusion they feared would ultimately portend the undoing of the nation&#x2019;s Protestant character, a pivotal minority, also Protestant, perceiving the ultimate benefit and justice of a religiously plural America, set about defending the rights of future Muslim citizens.<br> &nbsp;<br> They did so, however, not for the sake of actual Muslims, because none were known at the time to live in America. Instead, Jefferson and others defended Muslim rights for the sake of &#x201c;imagined Muslims,&#x201d; the promotion of whose theoretical citizenship would prove the true universality of American rights. Indeed, this defense of imagined Muslims would also create political room to consider the rights of other despised minorities whose numbers in America, though small, were quite real, namely Jews and Catholics. Although it was Muslims who embodied the ideal of inclusion, Jews and Catholics were often linked to them in early American debates, as Jefferson and others fought for the rights of all non-Protestants.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1783, the year of the nation&#x2019;s official independence from Great Britain, George Washington wrote to recent Irish Catholic immigrants in New York City. The American Catholic minority of roughly twenty- five thousand then had few legal protections in any state and, because of their faith, no right to hold political office in New York. Washing- ton insisted that &#x201c;the bosom of America&#x201d; was &#x201c;open to receive . . . the oppressed and the persecuted of all Nations and Religions; whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges.&#x201d; He would also write similar missives to Jewish communities, whose total population numbered only about two thousand at this time.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year later, in 1784, Washington theoretically enfolded Muslims into his private world at Mount Vernon. In a letter to a friend seeking a carpenter and bricklayer to help at his Virginia home, he explained that the workers&#x2019; beliefs&#x2014;or lack thereof&#x2014;mattered not at all: &#x201c;If they are good workmen, they may be of Asia, Africa, or Europe. They may be Mahometans [Muslims], Jews or Christian of an[y] Sect, or they may be Atheists.&#x201d; Clearly, Muslims were part of Washington&#x2019;s understanding of religious pluralism&#x2014;at least in theory. But he would not have actually expected any Muslim applicants.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although we have since learned that there were in fact Muslims resident in eighteenth-century America, this book demonstrates that the Founders and their generational peers never knew it. Thus their Muslim constituency remained an imagined, future one. But the fact that both Washington and Jefferson attached to it such symbolic significance is not accidental. Both men were heir to the same pair of opposing European traditions.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first, which predominated, depicted Islam as the antithesis of the &#x201c;true faith&#x201d; of Protestant Christianity, as well as the source of tyrannical governments abroad. To tolerate Muslims&#x2014;to accept them as part of a majority Protestant Christian society&#x2014;was to welcome people who professed a faith most eighteenth-century Europeans and Americans believed false, foreign, and threatening. Catholics would be similarly characterized in American Protestant founding discourse. Indeed, their faith, like Islam, would be deemed a source of tyranny and thus antithetical to American ideas of liberty.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to counter such fears, Jefferson and other supporters of non-Protestant citizenship drew upon a second, less popular but crucial stream of European thought, one that posited the toleration of Muslims as well as Jews and Catholics. Those few Europeans, both Catholic and Protestant, who first espoused such ideas in the sixteenth century often died for them. In the seventeenth century, those who advocated universal religious toleration frequently suffered death or imprisonment, banishment or exile, the elites and common folk alike. The ranks of these so-called heretics in Europe included Catholic and Protestant peasants, Protestant scholars of religion and political theory, and fervid Protestant dissenters, such as the first English Baptists&#x2014;but no people of political power or prominence. Despite not being organized, this minority consistently opposed their coreligionists by defending theoretical Muslims from persecution in Christian-majority states.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a member of the eighteenth-century Anglican establishment and a prominent political leader in Virginia, Jefferson represented a different sort of proponent for ideas that had long been the hallmark of dissident victims of persecution and exile. Because of his elite status, his own endorsement of Muslim citizenship demanded serious consideration in Virginia&#x2014;and the new nation. Together with a handful of like-minded American Protestants, he advanced a new, previously unthinkable national blueprint. Thus did ideas long on the fringe of European thought flow into the mainstream of American political dis- course at its inception.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that these ideas found universal welcome. Even a man of Jefferson&#x2019;s national reputation would be attacked by his political opponents for his insistence that the rights of all believers should be protected from government interference and persecution. But he drew support from a broad range of constituencies, including Anglicans (or Episcopalians), as well as dissenting Presbyterians and Baptists, who suffered persecution perpetrated by fellow Protestants. No denomination had a unanimously positive view of non-Protestants as full American citizens, yet support for Muslim rights was expressed by some members of each.<br> &nbsp;<br> What the supporters of Muslim rights were proposing was extraordinary even at a purely theoretical level in the eighteenth century. American citizenship&#x2014;which had embraced only free, white, male Protestants&#x2014;was in effect to be abstracted from religion. Race and gender would continue as barriers, but not so faith. Legislation in Virginia would be just the beginning, the First Amendment far from the end of the story; in fact, Jefferson, Washington, and James Madison would work toward this ideal of separation throughout their entire political lives, ultimately leaving it to others to carry on and finish the job. This book documents, for the first time, how Jefferson and others, despite their negative, often incorrect understandings of Islam, pursued that ideal by advocating the rights of Muslims and all non-Protestants.<br> &nbsp;<br> A decade before George Washington signaled openness to Muslim laborers in 1784 he had listed two slave women from West Africa among his taxable property. &#x201c;Fatimer&#x201d; and &#x201c;Little Fatimer&#x201d; were a mother and daughter&#x2014;both indubitably named after the Prophet Muhammad&#x2019;s daughter Fatima (d. 632). Washington advocated Muslim rights, never realizing that as a slaveholder he was denying Muslims in his own midst any rights at all, including the right to practice their faith. This tragic irony may well have also recurred on the plantations of Jefferson and Madison, although proof of their slaves&#x2019; religion remains less than definitive. Nevertheless, having been seized and transported from West Africa, the first American Muslims may have numbered in the tens of thousands, a population certainly greater than the resident Jews and possibly even the Catholics. Although some have speculated that a few former Muslim slaves may have served in the Continental Army, there is little direct evidence any practiced Islam and none that these individuals were known to the Founders. In any case, they had no influence on later political debates about Muslim citizenship.<br> &nbsp;<br> The insuperable facts of race and slavery rendered invisible the very believers whose freedoms men like Jefferson, Washington, and Madison defended, and whose ancestors had resided in America since the seventeenth century, as long as Protestants had. Indeed, when the Founders imagined future Muslim citizens, they presumably imagined them as white, because by the 1790s &#x201c;full American citizenship could be claimed by any free, white immigrant, regardless of ethnicity or religious beliefs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The two actual Muslims Jefferson would wittingly meet during his lifetime were not black West African slaves but North African ambassadors of Turkish descent. They may have appeared to him to have more melanin than he did, but he never commented on their complexions or race. (Other observers either failed to mention it or simply affirmed that the ambassador in question was not black.) But then Jefferson was interested in neither diplomat for reasons of religion or race; he engaged them because of their political power. (They were, of course, also free.)<br> &nbsp;<br> But even earlier in his political life&#x2014;as an ambassador, secretary of state, and vice president&#x2014;Jefferson had never perceived a predominantly religious dimension to the conflict with North African Muslim powers, whose pirates threatened American shipping in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. As this book demonstrates, Jefferson as president would insist to the rulers of Tripoli and Tunis that his nation harbored no anti-Islamic bias, even going so far as to express the extraordinary claim of believing in the same God as those men.<br> &nbsp;<br> The equality of believers that Jefferson sought at home was the same one he professed abroad, in both contexts attempting to divorce religion from politics, or so it seemed. In fact, Jefferson&#x2019;s limited but unique appreciation for Islam appears as a minor but active element in his presidential foreign policy with North Africa&#x2014;and his most personal Deist and Unitarian beliefs. The two were quite possibly entwined, with their source Jefferson&#x2019;s unsophisticated yet effective understanding of the Qur&#x2019;an he owned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, as a man of his time, Jefferson was not immune to negative feelings about Islam. He would even use some of the most popular anti- Islamic images inherited from Europe to drive his early political arguments about the separation of religion from government in Virginia. Yet ultimately Jefferson and others not as well known were still able to divorce the idea of Muslim citizenship from their dislike of Islam, as they forged an &#x201c;imagined political community,&#x201d; inclusive beyond all precedent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The clash between principle and prejudice that Jefferson himself overcame in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries remains a test for the nation in the twenty-first. Since the late nineteenth century, the United States has in fact become home to a diverse and dynamic American Muslim citizenry, but this population has never been fully welcomed. Whereas in Jefferson&#x2019;s time organized prejudice against Muslims was exercised against an exclusively foreign and imaginary nonresident population, today politic...</p></p><h2>Stylish Wraps Sewing Book: Ponchos, Capes, Coats and More - Fashionable Warmers that are Easy to Sew</h2><p><b>This DIY sewing book presents a fabulous new collection of lightweight wraps that are easy to sew and look fantastic!</b> <br><br><i>Stylish Wraps Sewing Book</i> provides 5 full-sized patterns that can be used to create 22 timeless wraps to keep the chill off&#x2014;and look great in the process.

He begins with the earliest European settlers, whose desire for vast forests to hunt in was frustrated by absentee owners&#x2015;including George Washington and other founders&#x2015;who laid claim to the region. Even as Daniel Boone became famous as a backwoods hunter and guide, the economy he represented was already in peril. Within just a few decades, Appalachian hunters and farmers went from pioneers to pariahs, from heroes to hillbillies, in the national imagination, and the area was locked into an enduring association with poverty and backwardness. Stoll traces these developments with empathy and precision, examining crucial episodes such as the Whiskey Rebellion, the founding of West Virginia, and the arrival of timber and coal companies that set off a devastating &#x201c;scramble for Appalachia.&#x201d;</p><p>At the center of <i>Ramp Hollow </i>is Stoll&#x2019;s sensitive portrayal of Appalachian homesteads. Perched upon ridges and tucked into hollows, they combined small-scale farming and gardening with expansive foraging and hunting, along with distilling and trading, to achieve self-sufficiency and resist the dependence on cash and credit arising elsewhere in the United States. But the industrialization of the mountains shattered the ecological balance that sustained the households. <i>Ramp Hollow </i>recasts the story of Appalachia as a complex struggle between mountaineers and profit-seeking forces from outside the region. Drawing powerful connections between Appalachia and other agrarian societies around the world, Stoll demonstrates the vitality of a peasant way of life that mixes farming with commerce but is not dominated by a market mind-set. His original investigation, ranging widely from history to literature, art, and economics, questions our assumptions about progress and development, and exposes the devastating legacy of dispossession and its repercussions today.</p></p><p><b>Steven Stoll</b> is a professor of history at Fordham University and the author of <i>The Great Delusion</i> (Hill and Wang, 2008) and <i>Larding the Lean Earth</i> (Hill and Wang, 2002).

I think it is an extraordinary achievement." <b>&#x2015;Elizabeth Blackmar, Professor of History, Columbia University</b><br><b></b> <br>"Steven Stoll's book will be powerfully influential. He begins in the hollows and follows the trail to global insights. We're deep in the dirt, then deep into texts. It's a difficult feat to pull off, but he accomplishes it in a way that is not only enlightening but glorious." <b>&#x2015;John Mack Faragher, Howard R. Lamar Professor of History and American Studies, Yale University</b></p><p><b>"</b>In this sweeping, provocative study, Steven Stoll comes to the defense of American pioneers and smallholders everywhere. Focusing on the mountaineers of West Virginia, Stoll argues that a largely successful household mode of production, connected to a larger ecological commons, was not isolated and backwards until it was impoverished by industrial invasion. He ties the undermining of Appalachia highlanders back to the enclosing of early-modern Britain, and to the continuing dispossession of African smallholders today." <b>&#x2015;Brian Donahue, Brandeis University</b></p></p><h2>The Spirit-Led Life: Christianity and the Internal Family System</h2><p>The Spirit-led Life is the story of one woman kicking and screaming her way to grace and spiritual maturity, particularly as it comes through the psycho-spiritual model of therapy known as Internal Family Systems. In the company of such characters as the Coyote Christ and Holy Canary, Mary Steege offers a theologically astute and spiritually sound look at the parallels between Christianity and the Internal Family Systems model. Humorous and poignant, this book points us toward our own experience of divine presence and the possibility of healing. It includes interviews on spirituality with Richard C. Schwartz, developer of the model.</p><p></p><h2>peluda (Button Poetry)</h2><p>One of the most original performance poets of her generation, Melissa Lozada-Oliva has captivated crowds across the country and online with her vivid narratives. Humorous and biting, personal and communal, self-deprecating and unapologetically self-loving, peluda (meaning "hairy" or "hairy beast") is the poet at her best.<br><br>The book explores the relationship between femininity and body hair as well as the intersections of family, class, the immigrant experience, Latina identity, and much more, all through Lozada-Oliva's unique lens and striking voice. Peluda is a powerful testimony on body image and the triumph over taboo.</p><p>Melissa Lozada-Oliva is a spoken word poet &amp; educator living in Boston whose fierceness and charm have made her a poetry phenomenon, with her work appearing on Upworthy, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, and countless other media outlets. Melissa's ability to speak truth to power as an unapologetically feminist Latina comes as a breath of fresh air to people expecting the "same old poetry." Blending power, warmth, and flat-out hilarity, Melissa leaves readers and audiences not only excited about changing the world, but excited about being a part of that change.</p><h2>The Healing Doll Way: A Guided Process Creating Art Dolls for Self-discovery, Awareness, and Transformation</h2><p>In The Healing Doll Way, Barb Kobe shares stories and images from her transformative experience becoming a healing doll artist, as well as those of many of her students and peers.

They had made an early start despite the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that a few forgotten items, or items they feared they had forgotten, had twice delayed their departure while first a maid and then the housekeeper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; herself hurried upstairs to look in their vacated rooms just in case.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret and Audrey were sisters and his second cousins to be precise. They had come to London for the wedding of Imogen Hayes, Lady Barclay, to Percy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl of Hardford. Audrey was the bride&#x2019;s mother. Imogen had stayed at Stanbrook House too until her wedding two days ago, partly because she was a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative, but mainly because there was no one in the world George loved more. There were five others he loved equally well, it was true, though Imogen<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the only woman and the only one related to him. The seven of them, himself included, were the members of the self-styled Survivors&#x2019; Club.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little over eight years ago George had made the decision to open Penderris Hall, his country seat in Cornwall, as a hospital and recovery center for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; military officers who had been severely wounded in the Napoleonic Wars and needed more intense and more extended care than could be provided by their<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; families. He had hired a skilled physician and other staff members willing to act as nurses, and he had handpicked the patients from among those<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended to him. There had been more than two dozen in all, most of whom had survived and returned to their families or regiments after a few weeks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or months. But six had remained for three years. Their injuries had varied widely. Not all had been physical. Hugo Emes, Lord Trentham, for example,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had been brought there without a scratch on his body but out of his mind and with a straitjacket restraining him from doing violence to himself or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep bond had developed among the seven of them, an attachment too strong to be severed even after they left Penderris and returned to their separate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lives. Those six people meant more to George than anyone else still living&#x2014;though perhaps that was not quite accurate, for he was dearly fond too of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his only nephew, Julian, and of Julian&#x2019;s wife, Philippa, and their infant daughter, Belinda. He saw them with fair frequency too and always with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure. They lived only a few miles from Penderris. Love, of course, did not move in hierarchies of preference. Love manifested itself in a thousand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different ways, all of which were love in its entirety. A strange thing, that, if one stopped to think about it.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lowered his hand, feeling suddenly foolish to be waving farewell to empty air, and turned back to the house. A footman hovered at the door, no doubt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anxious to close it. He was probably shivering in his shoes. A brisk early morning breeze was blowing across the square directly at him though there<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was plenty of blue sky above along with some scudding clouds in promise of a lovely mid-May day.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded to the young man and sent him to the kitchen to fetch coffee to the library.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning post had not arrived yet, he could see when he entered the room. The surface of the large oak desk before the window was bare except for a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clean blotter and an inkpot and two quill pens. There would be the usual pile of invitations when the post did arrive, it being the height of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London Season. He would be required to choose among balls and soirees and concerts and theater groups and garden parties and Venetian breakfasts and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private dinners and a host of other entertainments. Meanwhile his club offered congenial company and diversion, as did Tattersall&#x2019;s and the races and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his tailor and boot maker. And if he did not wish to go out, he was surrounded in this very room by bookshelves that reached from floor to ceiling,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupted only by doors and windows. If there was room for one more book on any of the shelves, he would be surprised. There were even a few books<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among them that he had not yet read but would doubtless enjoy.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a pleasant feeling to know that he might do whatever he wished with his time, even nothing at all if he so chose. The weeks leading up to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imogen&#x2019;s wedding and the few days since had been exceedingly busy ones and had allowed him very little time to himself. But he had enjoyed the busyness<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and had to admit that there was a certain flatness mingled with his pleasure this morning in the knowledge that yet again he was alone and free and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beholden to no one. The house seemed very quiet, even though his cousins had not been noisy or demanding houseguests. He had enjoyed their company far<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than he had expected. They were virtual strangers, after all. He had not seen either sister for a number of years before this past week.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imogen herself was the closest of friends but could have caused some upheaval due to her impending nuptials. She had not. She was not a fussy bride in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the least. One would hardly have known, in fact, that she was preparing for her wedding, except that there had been a new and unfamiliar glow about her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that had warmed George&#x2019;s heart.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wedding breakfast had been held at Stanbrook House. He had insisted upon it, though both Ralph and Flavian, their fellow Survivors, had offered to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; host it too. Half the <i>ton</i> had been present, filling the ballroom almost to overflowing and inevitably spilling out into other rooms in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hours following the meal and all the speeches. And <i>breakfast</i> was certainly a misnomer, since very few of the guests had left until late in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evening.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George had enjoyed every moment.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the festivities were all over, and after the wedding Imogen had left with Percy for a honeymoon in Paris. Now Audrey and Margaret were gone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; too, although before leaving they had hugged him tightly, thanked him effusively for his hospitality, and begged him to come and stay with them in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cumberland sometime soon.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a strong sense of finality about this morning. There had been a flurry of weddings in the last two years, including those of all the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survivors and George&#x2019;s nephew, all the people most dear to him in the world. Imogen had been the last of them&#x2014;with the exception of himself, of course.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he hardly counted. He was forty-eight years old and, after eighteen years of marriage, he had been a widower for more than twelve years.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was glad to see that the fire in the library had been lit. He had got chilled standing outside. He took the chair to one side of the fireplace and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held out his hands to the blaze. The footman brought the tray a few minutes later, poured his coffee, and set the cup and saucer on the small table<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beside him along with a plate of sweet biscuits that smelled of butter and nutmeg.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; George added milk and a little sugar to the dark brew and remembered for no apparent reason how it had always irritated his wife that he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledged even the slightest service paid him by a servant. Doing so would only lower him in their esteem, she had always explained to him.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed almost incredible that all six of his fellow Survivors had married within the past two years. It was as if they had needed the three years<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after leaving Penderris to adjust to the outside world again after the sheltered safety the house had provided during their recovery, but had then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rushed joyfully back into full and fruitful lives. Perhaps, having hovered for so long close to death and insanity, they had needed to celebrate life<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself. He was quite certain too that they had all made happy marriages. Hugo and Vincent each had a child already, and there was another on the way<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Vincent and Sophia. Ralph and Flavian were also in expectation of fatherhood. Even Ben, another of their number, had whispered two days ago that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samantha had been feeling queasy for the past few mornings and was hopeful that it was in a good cause.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all thoroughly heartwarming to the man who had opened his home and his heart to men&#x2014;and one woman&#x2014;who had been broken by war and might have<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remained forever on the fringes of their own lives if he had not done so. If they had survived at all, that was.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George looked speculatively at the biscuits but did not take one. He picked up his coffee cup, however, and warmed his hands about it, ignoring the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handle.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it downright contrary of him to be feeling ever so slightly depressed this morning? Imogen&#x2019;s wedding had been a splendidly festive and happy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occasion. George loved to see her glow, and, despite some early misgivings, he liked Percy too and thought it probable he was the perfect husband for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her. George was very fond of the wives of the other Survivors too. In many ways he felt like a smugly proud father who had married off his brood to so<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many happily-ever-afters.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that was the trouble, though. For he was not their father, was he? Or anyone else&#x2019;s for that matter. He frowned into his coffee, considered<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding more sugar, decided against doing so, and took another sip. His only son had died at the age of seventeen during the early years of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsular Wars, and his wife&#x2014;Miriam&#x2014;had taken her own life just a few months later.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, George thought as he gazed sightlessly into his cup, very much alone&#x2014;though no more so now than he had been before Imogen&#x2019;s wedding and all the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others. Julian was his late brother&#x2019;s son, not his own, and his six fellow Survivors had all left Penderris Hall five years ago. Although the bonds of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship had remained strong and they all gathered for three weeks every year, usually at Penderris, they were not literally family. Even Imogen was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only his second cousin once removed.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had moved on with their lives, those six, and left him behind. And what a blasted pathetic, self-pitying thought <i>that</i> was.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George drained his cup, set it down none too gently on the saucer, put both on the tray, and got restlessly to his feet. He moved behind the desk and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stood looking out through the window onto the square. It was still early enough that there was very little activity out there. The clouds were sparser<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they had been earlier, the sky a more uniform blue. It was the sort of day designed to lift the human spirit.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was lonely, damn it. To the marrow of his bones and the depths of his soul.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He almost always had been.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His adult life had begun brutally early. He had taken up a military commission with great excitement at the age of seventeen, having convinced his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father that a career in the army was what he wanted more than anything else in life. But just four months later he had been summoned back home when his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father had learned that he was dying. Before he turned eighteen, George had sold out his cornetcy, married Miriam, lost his f...</p></p><h2>Bridge to Terabithia (Movie Tie-in)</h2><p><p><strong>Now a major motion picture from Disney, starring Josh Hutcherson and Zooey Deschanel!&nbsp;Discover the beloved Newbery Medal-winning story by bestselling author Katherine Paterson, a modern classic of friendship and loss.</strong></p><p>Jess Aarons has been practicing all summer so he can be the fastest runner in the fifth grade.

Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells.<br><br>From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.</p><p><strong>Paul Beyerl</strong> is a well-known master herbalist and Wiccan author.

Rose Mary Dougherty&#39;s writing acknowledges the growing need that many people have for small communities of support in their relationship with God, and it describes the diverse means that various religious traditions and denominations have used to address this need. The text presents group spiritual direction as a unique form of spiritual community which assists people in ongoing individual discernment. Drawing on years of experience as a spiritual director and as one who has offered group spiritual direction in ecumenical settings, the author provides both the theological understanding and the detailed information needed to establish spiritual direction groups. She consistently invites the reader to return to her primary assumption: the most important element in group spiritual direction is the contemplative stance of presence to God for one another within the group meeting and prayer for one another outside the meeting. The author also offers practical suggestions for fostering this contemplative stance as well as ways to prepare people for group spiritual direction.Rose Mary Dougherty, S.S.N.D., currently serves as Director for Spiritual Guidance at the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Bethesda, MD.</p><h2>The Irresistible Blueberry Bakeshop &amp; Cafe</h2><p><b>"You will devour <i>The Irresistible Blueberry Bakeshop &amp;Cafe</i>.

All because of a box of cheap jewelry.<br><br>The marina was closed this late at night, but Roger still kept to the shadows as he walked toward the docks. He&#x2019;d picked this place because it was mostly open and flat; he could see who approached. Tonight, the marina was empty of people, covered boats monuments to warmer days. The security lights over the docks provided the only illumination; it was too foggy to see D.C. on the other side of the Potomac.<br><br>He stuffed his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, wishing he had a warmer coat. It was friggin&#x2019; cold. He couldn&#x2019;t wait to grab his money and get out of this miserable town. He already had a place lined up in South America. Even after six years in prison, Roger had contacts. Once he had the money in hand, he&#x2019;d be sitting pretty.<br><br>Six long years behind bars. His attorney had said he was lucky to get away with only that after attempted murder of a federal agent and felony rape. Six years in the federal pen was lucky? He&#x2019;d spilled his guts, given the cops everything they wanted, admitted to everything&#x2014;well, he had left out the crucial detail that he&#x2019;d killed one of their own people. That fact he&#x2019;d most certainly kept to himself, thanks very much. Anyway, the Feds didn&#x2019;t have anything implicating him&#x2014;no gun, no witnesses, nothing. It had been easy enough to lay blame for that escapade on someone else.<br><br>Six years of his life gone. For cooperating.<br><br>Everything had changed while he was in the pen, and he was damned if he was going to sit around working as a car mechanic making chump change. Not when he knew how to make real money. The kind of serious dough that would set him up in his previous lifestyle, the kind that bought freedom. In prison, his life had been on hold. Now he had the chance to start over.<br><br>Adam had spouted off that Roger was the dumb one. Well, Adam was dead&#x2014;how smart did that make him?<br><br>Roger cautiously approached the meeting spot on the far side of the dry docks. The air coming off the Potomac was so damn cold he wished they could have found a bar to make the exchange. Except Roger couldn&#x2019;t be seen in his old stomping grounds. He had to keep a low profile. Make the exchange on neutral ground. Of course, he&#x2019;d left his half of the bargain back at his motel. No fucking way was he going to have his new partner double-cross him. First, he&#x2019;d get the money, then he&#x2019;d tell him where to find the jewelry. He wasn&#x2019;t an idiot; cops were bastards and Roger wouldn&#x2019;t put it past any of them to set him up. But he&#x2019;d vetted this guy, demanding to see some of the action he planned on sharing with Roger&#x2019;s new venture. No way he was a cop.<br><br>Roger had enjoyed the digital files of young women getting screwed every which way. Some were experienced actresses; others were junkies desperate for a quick buck to pay for their next fix. Some of the recordings&#x2014;the best, in his opinion&#x2014;were those where the chicks didn&#x2019;t even know they were being filmed. Amateur whores&#x2014;Roger saw the marketing potential for that campaign, practically salivating over the dollars he&#x2019;d rake in. Straight porn wasn&#x2019;t illegal, but the money was in edgier areas&#x2014;hidden cameras, underage teens, fantasy rape that wasn&#x2019;t necessarily consensual.<br><br>When there was this kind of money involved, he knew not to bring the merchandise without cash up front. All of it. They&#x2019;d tried to pull a fast one on him yesterday; they&#x2019;d learned real quick they weren&#x2019;t dealing with a novice. Adam had been a prick, but he&#x2019;d taught Roger the tricks of the trade. Only now, with Adam six feet under, Roger wouldn&#x2019;t have to take orders or get a small percentage of the take. He&#x2019;d run the website, handle the back end, and his new partner would provide the sex tapes. Fifty-fifty split. Roger was confident the cash would stream in fast, and he&#x2019;d learned from Adam how to manage the credit cards of their customers and funnel money to offshore accounts. Best of all, without Adam around, Roger wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry anymore about the snuff films that had brought the Feds down on them in the first place. If Adam hadn&#x2019;t gotten his ya-yas off strangling the women he screwed, they&#x2019;d never have been busted. Rape was a crime, but murder was a whole other story.<br><br>All Roger needed was some up-front cash to set up the offshore operation. It didn&#x2019;t matter that he was on parole; he&#x2019;d skip out and never again step on American soil. That took more money than he could make working fifty-hour weeks at his cousin&#x2019;s car dealership changing oil. Originally, he&#x2019;d demanded twenty thousand for startup costs, but when they expressed interest in Adam&#x2019;s old jewelry box, Roger doubled the buy-in.<br><br>Roger&#x2019;s contacts had given him the thumbs-up on the players involved, but he still hadn&#x2019;t liked any of the meeting places they suggested&#x2014;too great a chance of being caught on a damn security camera. He&#x2019;d told them the marina. Secluded, but close to everything and best of all, no surveillance cameras, few hiding places, and no witnesses. He was taking a risk, but the potential rewards were well worth it. Besides, using his old contacts, Roger had tracked these guys down. It wasn&#x2019;t as though they&#x2019;d been looking for him. He&#x2019;d kept a low profile since getting out six months ago.<br><br>He&#x2019;d rather be dead than go back.<br><br>He spotted his new partner approaching the rendezvous point. The man was wearing jeans, a dark windbreaker, and a Yankees baseball cap&#x2014;just like he&#x2019;d said. Roger glanced around, saw no one else, and waited for the man to reach him.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Roger said casually, sizing up the other man.<br><br>&#x201c;The box?&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s voice was raspy, as if he&#x2019;d been a two-pack-a-day smoker for decades, though he didn&#x2019;t smell of cigarettes now.<br><br>&#x201c;You got my advance?&#x201d; Roger was waiting for entrapment clues&#x2014;such as him explicitly saying that he was using the money to set up an illegal porn website&#x2014;but the guy didn&#x2019;t go into details. An agreement could mean anything in court. Sure, he was in the marina after dark&#x2014;a misdemeanor, and he could technically be thrown back in prison for even the smallest slip-up&#x2014;but they still couldn&#x2019;t get him on anything big.<br><br>&#x201c;I want the jewelry box and everything inside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see the money first.&#x201d; Did this guy think he was an idiot?<br><br>Tensing as the man reached into his pocket, Roger&#x2019;s hand moved to the gun in his waistband, but he didn&#x2019;t need to use it. His new partner handed him an envelope.<br><br>Roger frowned. &#x201c;A little thin for forty g&#x2019;s. This isn&#x2019;t what we agreed to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were supposed to bring the box.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were supposed to give me half the cash yesterday. What kind of partnership is this if you can&#x2019;t live up to your end of the deal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Open it. You&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d;<br><br>Cautious, but curious, Roger opened the unsealed envelope and removed a folded piece of paper. It was blank, with a faded photo tucked between the folds. A beautiful teenage girl with long black hair and large, sultry brown eyes stared at him in the faint light.<br><br>His instincts had him reacting almost before he recognized the dead girl, but not fast enough. Roger dropped the photo and paper and went for his gun, but the man moved faster, karate-kicking his wrist. In the faint glow from the dim lights over the dry dock, for the first time Roger saw the man&#x2019;s face dead-on.<br><br>Another ghost from his past.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish I could be the one to put the bullet in your head,&#x201d; the man said before slamming Roger face first into the hard-packed dirt. A burst of pain told him his nose might be broken. He swallowed a thick wad of blood.<br><br>Coughing, Roger tried to rise, but the traitor kicked him between the legs three times with steel-toed boots. Excruciating pain froze him. It was worse than when he&#x2019;d been raped in prison. And then, he&#x2019;d had his revenge. This time he wouldn&#x2019;t get the chance. Panic and self-preservation rose with the pain as he tried to stand, only to be knocked back down.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Morton.&#x201d; The quiet, cultured voice didn&#x2019;t belong to his attacker. Roger hadn&#x2019;t heard another man approach, and the idea that two&#x2014;or more&#x2014;men stood over him made him tremble even as he tried to get up one last time.<br><br>A boot in his balls had him seeing nothing. He almost didn&#x2019;t hear the slide of the nine-millimeter.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish this hurt you more, but in this case expediency is more important than my personal satisfaction at seeing you suffer. Rot in Hell, bastard.&#x201d;<br><br>Roger Morton was dead before he registered the sound of the gunshot.</p><h2>Momma and the Meaning of Life: Tales of Psychotherapy</h2><p><p><strong>Psychotherapist Irvin D. Yalom probes further into the mysteries of the therapeutic encounter in this entertaining and thoughtful follow-up to his bestselling <em>Love's Executioner</em></strong> </p><p></p><p>In six enthralling stories drawn from his own clinical experience, Irvin D. Yalom once again proves himself an intrepid explorer of the human psyche as he guides his patients--and himself--toward transformation. With eloquent detail and sharp-eyed observation Yalom introduces us to a memorable cast of characters. Drifting through his dreams and trampling through his thoughts are Paula, Yalom's "courtesan of death"; Myrna, whose eavesdropping gives new meaning to patient confidentiality; Magnolia, into whose ample lap Yalom longs to pour his own sorrows, even as he strives to ease hers; and Momma--ill-tempered, overpowering, and suffocating her son with both love and disapproval. </p><p>A richly rewarding, almost illicit glimpse into the therapist's heart and mind, <em>Momma and the Meaning of Life </em>illuminates the unique potential of every human relationship.</p></p><p>Tales of therapy are also tales of therapists, and Irvin D. Yalom--author of much bestselling psychiatric fiction <i>and</i> nonfiction--is a seasoned storyteller. This new collection of "tales from the couch," part memoir and part fiction, is the work of a therapist unafraid to become deeply engaged with his patients; people, not pathology, are the stuff of Yalom's psychotherapy. Ego, doubt, and fantasy are rarely confined to the couch, and the doctor learns as much from his patients as they from him.<p> Here Yalom introduces us to Paula, whose losing fight against cancer teaches us that fear is only one of the many colors that brighten our dying; to Irene, a skilled surgeon whose dreams provide tantalizing clues for the psychological gumshoe intent on discovering the irrational terror behind her impressive intellect; to Magnolia, the earth mother whose inexplicable paralysis and imaginary infestations seemed her body's way of punishing her for aspirations aimed too high; and to Momma herself, half protector, half mythological monster, guardian at the gates of the psychotherapist's own unconscious. And, opening up the case files of the fictional Ernest Lash, Yalom reminds us that psychiatrists, too, are human. Like Oliver Sacks, Yalom spins the labyrinth threads of consciousness into the rich tapestry of something much grander. Therapy is not for the weak of heart, doctor or patient; in these pages, the journey toward healing and self-awareness reveals itself to be not about passivity, but courage. <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i></p><strong>Irvin D. Yalom, M.D.</strong>, is the author of&nbsp;<em>The Schopenhauer Cure</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lying on the Couch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Every Day Gets a Little Closer</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Love's Executioner</em>, as well as several classic textbooks on psychotherapy.&nbsp;<em>When Nietzsche Wept</em>&nbsp;was a bestseller in Germany, Israel, Greece, Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil with millions of copies sold worldwide.

In this stirring graphic non-fiction book by the acclaimed author of <i>The 500 Years of Resistance Comic Book,</i> Gord Hill looks at the history of fascism over the last 100 years, and the concurrent antifa movements that work fastidiously to topple it. <br> <br> Fascism is a relatively new political ideology and movement, yet in its short history some of the greatest atrocities against humanity have been carried out in its name. Its poisonous roots have taken hold in every region of the world, from its beginnings in post-World War I Italy, through Nazi Germany, Franco&#x2019;s Spain, and the KKK in America. And today, emboldened by the American president, fascism is alive and well again. At the same time, antifa activists have proven, through history and again today, that the spirit of resistance is alive and well, and necessary.<br> <br> In <i>The Antifa Comic Book</i>, Gord Hill documents these powerful moments of conflict and confrontation with a perceptive eye and a powerful sense of resolve.</p><p>Gord Hill is an Indigenous writer, artist, and activist of the Kwakwaka'wakw nation.

His art and writings have also been published in numerous periodicals, including <i>Briarpatch, Canadian Dimension, Redwire, Red Rising Magazine, The Dominion, Recherches Amerindiennes au Quebec, Intotemak, Seattle Weekly,</i> and <i>Broken Pencil.</i>This brightly colored, action-filled graphic narrative details the long, deep history of fascism and opposition to it ... The book sounds the warning that refusing to recognize the threat and failing to respond physically means failing to learn from history. Even those who oppose Antifa's tactics will find their perspective broadened by this graphic history. -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>A riveting and fact-based history that feels more important than ever ... Hill utilizes the boldness of his graphic medium to venerate the struggle against bigotry, but despite this larger than life lionization, he grounds his story in truth and fact. -<i>Booklist</i> <b>(STARRED REVIEW)</b><br><br>An informative and fascinating graphic novel history of fascism and those who fought it. -<i>Vancouver Sun</i></p><h2>Christian Self-Mastery: How to Govern Your Thoughts, Discipline Your Will, and Achieve Balance in Your Spiritual Life</h2><p><p>This is the book you need for those times in your life when even your most strenuous efforts to follow Christ end in frustration. <em>Christian Self-Mastery</em> explains why following Him can be so difficult and how you can start now to make progress even in the most vexing areas of your life.</p> <p>Author Fr.

Its title story recounts the story of a reform school cross-country runner who seizes the perfect opportunity to defy the authority that governs his life. It is a pure masterpiece. From there the collection expands even further from the touching &#x201c;On Saturday Afternoon&#x201d; to the rollicking &#x201c;The Decline and Fall and Frankie Buller.&#x201d; Beloved for its lean prose, unforgettable protagonists, and real-life wisdom,<i> The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i> captured the voice of a generation, and its poignant and empowering life lessons will continue to captivate and entertain readers for generations to come.</p><p>Alan Sillitoe was born in 1928, the son of a tannery worker. He left school at age fourteen to work in a factory. He was one of the working-class novelists who revitalized British fiction in the 1950s. His first novel <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i> was followed with the bestselling collection <i>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i>. He adapted both works for the screen in the early 1960s. He is the author of more than 40 works of prose, poetry, and drama.As soon as I got to Borstal they made me a long-distance cross-country runner. I suppose they thought I was just the build for it because I was long and skinny for my age (and still am) and in any case I didn't mind it much, to tell you the truth, because running had always been made much of in our family, especially running away from the police. I've always been a good runner, quick and with a big stride as well, the only trouble being that no matter how fast I run, and I did a very fair lick even though I do say so myself, it didn't stop me getting caught by the cops after that bakery job.<br><br>You might think it a bit rare, having long-distance cross-country runners in Borstal, thinking that the first thing a long-distance cross-country runner would do when they set him loose at them fields and woods would be to run as far away from the place as he could get on a bellyful of Borstal slumgullion-but you're wrong, and I'll tell you why. The first thing is that them bastards over us aren't as daft as they most of the time look, and for another thing I'm not so daft as I would look if I tried to make a break for it on my long-distance running, because to abscond and then get caught is nothing but a mug's game, and I'm not falling for it. Cunning is what counts in this life, and even that you've got to use in the slyest way you can; I'm telling you straight: they're cunning, and I'm cunning. If only 'them' and 'us' had the same ideas we'd get on like a house on fire, but they don't see eye to eye with us and we don't see eye to eye with them, so that's how it stands and how it will always stand. The one fact is that all of us are cunning, and because of this there's no love lost between us. So the thing is that they know I won't try to get away from them: they sit there like spiders in that crumbly manor house, perched like jumped-up jackdaws on the roof, watching out over the drives and fields like German generals from the tops of tanks. And even when I jog-trot on behind a wood and they can't see me anymore they know my sweeping-brush head will bob along that hedge-top in an hour's time and that I'll report to the bloke on the gate. Because when on a raw and frosty morning I get up at five 0'clock and stand shivering my belly off on the stone floor and all the rest still have another hour to snooze before the bells go, I slink downstairs through all the corridors to the big outside door with a permit running-card in my :fist, I feel like the first and last man on the world, both at once, if you can believe what I'm trying to say. I feel like the first man because I've hardly got a stitch on and am sent against the frozen fields in a shimmy and shorts-even the first poor bastard dropped on to the earth in midwinter knew how to make a suit of leaves, or how to skin a pterodactyl for a topcoat. But there I am, frozen stiff, with nothing to get me warm except a couple of hours' long-distance running before breakfast, not even a slice of bread-and-sheepdip. They're training me up fine for the big sports day when all the pig-faced snotty-nosed dukes and ladies-who can't add two and two together and would mess themselves like loonies if they didn't have slavies to beck-and-call--come and make speeches to us about sports being just the thing to get us leading an honest life and keep our itching finger-ends off them shop locks and safe handles and hairgrips to open gas meters. They give us a bit of blue ribbon and a cup for a prize after we've shagged ourselves out running or jumping, like race horses, only we don't get so well looked-after as race horses, that's the only thing.<br><br>So there I am, standing in the doorway in shimmy and shorts, not even a dry crust in my guts, looking out at frosty flowers on the ground. I suppose you think this is enough to make me cry? Not likely. Just because I feel like the first bloke in the world wouldn't make me bawl. It makes me feel fifty times better than when I'm cooped up in that dormitory with three hundred others. No, it's sometimes when I stand there feeling like the last man in the world that I don't feel so good. I feel like the last man in the world because I think that all those three hundred sleepers behind me are dead. They sleep so well I think that every scruffy head's kicked the bucket in the night and I'm the only one left, and when I look out into the bushes and frozen ponds I have the feeling that it's going to get colder and colder until everything I can see, meaning my red arms as well, is going to be covered with a thousand miles of ice, all the earth, right up to the sky and over every bit of land and sea. So I try to kick this feeling out and act like I'm the first man on earth. And that makes me feel good, so as soon as I'm steamed up en9ugh to get this feeling in me, I take a flying leap out of the doorway, and off I trot.<br><br>I'm in Essex. It's supposed to be a good Borstal, at least that's what the governor said to me when I got here from Nottingham. u We want to trust you while you are in this establishment," he said, smoothing out his newspaper with lily-white workless hands, while I read the big words upside down: Daily Telegraph. "If you play ball with us, we'll play ball with you." (Honest to God, you'd have thought it was going to be one long tennis match.) H We want hard honest work and we want good athletics,'; he said as well. " And if you give us both these things you can be sure we'll do right by you and send you back into the world an honest man." Well, I could have died laughing, especially when straight after this I hear the barking sergeant-major's voice calling me and two others to attention and marching us off like we was Grenadier Guards. And when the governor kept saying how 4 we' wanted you to do this, and 4 we ' wanted you to do that, I kept looking round for the other blokes, wondering how many of them there was. Of course, I knew there were thousands of them, but as far as I knew only one was in the room. And there are thousands of them, all over the poxeaten country, in shops, offices, railway stations, cars, houses, pubs -In-law blokes like you and them, all on the watch for Outlaw blokes like me and us-and waiting to 'phone for the coppers as soon as we make a false move. And it'll always be there, I'll tell you that now, because I haven't finished making all my false moves yet, and I dare say I won't until I kick the bucket. If the In-laws are hoping to stop me making false moves they're wasting their time. They might as well stand me up against a wall and let fly with a dozen rifles. That's the only way they'll stop me, and a few million others. Because I've been doing a lot of thinking since coming here. They can spy on us all day to see if we're pulling our puddings and if we're working good or doing our 4 athletics' but they can't make an X-ray of our guts to find out what we're telling ourselves. I've been asking myself all sorts of questions, and thinking about my life up to now. And I like doing all this. It's a treat. It passes the time away and don't make Borstal seem half so bad as the boys in our street used to say it was. And this long-distance running lark is 'the best of all, because it makes me think so good that I learn things even better than when I'm on my bed at night. And apart from that, what with thinking so much while I'm running I'm getting to be one of the best runners in the Borstal. I can go my five miles round better than anybody else I know.<br><br>So as soon as I tell myself I'm the :first man ever to be dropped into the world, and as soon as I take that first flying leap out into the frosty grass of an early morning when even birds haven't the heart to whistle, I get to thinking, and that's what I like. I go my rounds in a dream, turning at lane or footpath corners without knowing I'm turning, leaping brooks without knowing they're there, and shouting good morning to the early cow-milker without seeing him. It's a treat, being a long-distance runner. out in the world by yourself with not a soul to make you bad-tempered or tell you what to do or that there's a shop to break and enter a bit back from the next street. Sometimes I think that I've never been so free as during that couple of hours when I'm trotting up the path out of the gates and turning by that bare-faced, big-bellied oak tree at the lane end. Everything's dead, but good, because it's dead before coming alive, not dead after being alive. That's how I look at it. Mind you, I often feel frozen stiff at first. I can't feel my hands or feet or flesh at all, like I'm a ghost who wouldn't know the earth was under him if he didn't see it now and again through the mist. But even though some people would call this frost-pain suffering if they wrote about it to their mams in a letter, I don't, because I know that in half an hour I'm going to be warm, that by the time I get to the main road and am turning on to the wheatfield footpath by the bus stop I'm going to feel as hot as a potbellied stove and as happy as a dog with a tin tail.<br><br>It's a good life, I'm saying to myself, if you don't give in to coppers and Borstal-bosses and the rest of them bastard-faced In-laws. Trot-trot-trot. Puff-puff-puff. Slap-slap-slap go my feet on the hard soil. Swish-swish-swish as my arms and side catch the bare branches of a bush. For I'm seventeen now, and when they let me out of this-if I don't make a break and see that things turn out otherwise-they'll try to get me in the army, and what's the difference between the army and this place I'm in now? They can't kid me, the bastards. I've seen the barracks near where I live, and if there weren't swaddies on guard outside with rifles you wouldn't know the difference between their high walls and the place I'm in now. Even though the swaddies come out at odd times a week for a pint of ale, so what? Don't I come out three mornings a week on my long-distance running, which is fifty times better than boozing. When they first said that I was to do my long-distance running without a guard pedalling beside me on a bike I couldn't believe it; but they called it a progressive and modern place, though they can't kid me because I know it's just like any other Borstal, going by the stories I've heard, except that they let me trot about like this. Borstal's Borstal no matter what they do; but anyway I moaned about it being a bit thick sending me out so early to run five miles on an empty stomach, until they talked me round to thinking it wasn't so bad-which I knew all the time-until they called me a good sport and patted me on the back when I said I'd do it and that I'd try to win them the Borstal Blue Ribbon Prize Cup For Long Distance Cross Country Running (All England). And now the governor talks to me when he comes on his rounds, almost as he'd talk to his prize race horse, if he had one.<br><br>All right, Smith? he asks.<br><br>" Yes, sir," I answer.<br><br>He flicks his grey moustache: How's the running coming along? "<br><br>I've set myself to trot round the grounds after dinner just to keep my hand in, sir," I tell him.<br><br>The pot-bellied pop-eyed bastard gets pleased at this: Good show. I know you'll get us that cup," he says.<br><br>And I swear under my breath: Like boggery, I will." No, I won't get them that cup, even though the stupid tash-twitching bastard has all his hopes in me. Because what does his barmy hope mean? I ask myself. Trot-trot-trot, slap-slap-slap, over the stream and into the wood where it's almost dark and frosty-dew twigs sting my legs. It don't mean a bloody thing to me, only to him, and it means as much to him as it would mean to me if I picked up the racing paper and put my bet on a hoss I didn't know, had never seen, and didn't care a sod if I ever did see. That's what it means to him. And I'll lose that race, because I'm not a race horse at all, and I'll let him know it when I'm about to get out~if I don't sling my hook even before the race. By Christ I will. I'm a human being and I've got thoughts and secrets and bloody life inside me that he doesn't know is there, and he'll never know what's there because he's stupid. I suppose you'll laugh at this, me saying the governor's a stupid bastard when I know hardly how to write and he can read and write and add-up like a professor. But what I say is true right enough. He's stupid, and I'm not, because I can see further into the likes of him than he can see into the likes of me. Admitted, we're both cunning, but I'm more cunning and I'll win in the end even if I die in gaol at eighty-two, because I'll have more fun and fire out of my life than he'll ever get out of his. He's read a thousand books I suppose, and for all I know he might even have written a few, but I know for a dead cert, as sure as I'm sitting here, that what I'm scribbling down is worth a million to what he could ever scribble down. I don't care what anybody says, but that's the truth and can't be denied. I know when he talks to me and I look into his army mug that I'm alive and he's dead.</p><h2>I Am Not a Toilet Paper Roll: 10 Incredible Things to Make with Toilet Paper Rolls</h2><p><b>Take your craft projects to a whole new level with this ingenious series that turns recycling into an art form!</b> <br><br> Imaginations will soar as kids take a plain old toilet paper roll and turn it into a unicorn, pirate, treasure chest, ninja, space rocket, or castle.

Laura Joplin shows us not only the public Janice who could drink Jim Morrison under the table and bean him with a bottle of booze when he got fresh; she shows us the private Janis, struggling to perfect her art, searching for the balance between love and stardom, battling to overcome her alcohol addiction and heroin use in a world where substance abuse was nearly universal.</p><p> At the heart of <i>Love</i>, Janis is an astonishing series of letters by Janis herself that have never been previously published. In them she conveys as no one else could the wild ride from awkward small&#x2013;town teenager to rock&#x2013;and&#x2013;roll queen. Love, Janis is the new life of Janis Joplin we have been waiting for&#x2013;a celebration of the sixties' joyous experimentation and creativity, and a loving, compassionate examination of one of that era's greatest talents.</p></p><p>Janis Joplin&#39;s sister has fashioned a biography from the letters Janis wrote to her family during her turbulent career. The book articulates the confusion of this artist&#39;s life in the drug culture of the late sixties. Winger makes little vocal distinction between Laura&#39;s narrative and Janis&#39;s letters. Winger&#39;s voice is simultaneously gravelly, sexy and raw, yet sweet and charming. It suitably conveys the pathos of Janis Joplin, a young star who wrote home about the lifestyle that killed her. One wishes for more than a few innocuous bars of Joplin&#39;s music at the program&#39;s conclusion. D.W.K. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineJoplin pens a bio of her legendary older sister that's more detailed and evenhanded, yet much less dramatic and emotionally raw, than Myra Friedman's bestselling Buried Alive (1973)--and includes the rock star's unpublished letters home, more revealing for Janis's aren't-you-proud-of-me? eagerness of tone than for their contents. Describing Janis's early life and influences, especially the high cultural and educational ideals of her parents, Joplin sometimes employs a tone of stuffy propriety that seems decidedly strange--after all, this is Janis Joplin she's describing. Getting into Janis's years at the Univ. of Texas, however, Joplin rises to the task. She debunks the tale that Janis was voted ``Ugly Man on Campus'' (she was nominated by friends, not detractors, and she didn't win). But Janis was plenty tormented and complex, and we get the impression that her life would have been all booze and unfocused angry rebellion and squalor if it hadn't been for Ken Threadgill, the Austin barkeep who recognized her extraordinary musical gifts and launched her career. Once in San Francisco, Janis teamed up with a ragged, soulful band called ``Big Brother and the Holding Company,'' and all her untamable demons channelled into her art. Her performances were electric. One West Coast critic called Janis a ``shaman woman,'' and Janis didn't disagree: ``I do believe in some very amorphous things that happen when you're onstage...like something moves in the air.'' At once narcissistic and sensitive, hard-driven and childlike, the Janis that emerges here was trapped by her ``get it while you can'' image--and she apparently thought heroin oblivion was her only way out. A thorough, restrained account of an extraordinary rise and fall. (Thirty-two pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jason Wright has written the next Christmas classic." <i>--Glenn Beck, radio host and CEO of Mercury Radio Arts</i> <br><br>Christmas Jars shares the story of Hope Jensen, an aspiring journalist who uncovers the remarkable secret behind a holiday phenomenon: money-filled glass jars anonymously given to people in need. Hope desperately wants to post the story, but doing so would be a breach of trust to the family who entrusted her with the secret. What she decides to do will change her life forever. A heartwarming story that will restore your faith in humanity and make you want to start your own Christmas Jar tradition. <br><br> This beautiful hardcover collector's edition contains the complete text of the bestselling fictional holiday favorite as well as more than twenty true, inspiring stories of people who have experienced the Christmas Jar miracle in their own lives by either giving or receiving an anonymous jar full of coins.</p><p>Jason F. Wright is a <i>New York Times, Wall Street Journal, </i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of ten novels. Articles by Jason have appeared in more than fifty newspapers and magazines across the United States including <i>The Washington Times, The Chicago Tribune, </i> and <i>Forbes</i>. He has been seen on FoxNews, CNN, CSPAN and on many local and national radio shows. He lives with his wife, Kodi, and their four children in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.In a plot reminiscent of Penelope Stokes's The Blue Bottle Club and Angela Hunt's The Note, a journalist happens upon a human interest story that winds up teaching her lessons about love and forgiveness and renewing her own faith in human kindness. On Christmas Eve, twenty-something Hope Jensen is quietly grieving the recent loss of her adoptive mother when her apartment is robbed. The one bright spot in the midst of Hope's despair is a small jar full of money someone has anonymously left on her doorstep. Eager to learn the source of this unexpected generosity, Hope uses her newswoman instincts to find other recipients of "Christmas jars," digging until her search leads her to the family who first began the tradition of saving a year's worth of spare change to give to someone in need at the holiday. Wright commits some rookie mistakes in style and pacing; the novel veers heavily toward melodrama at some junctures, and he tends to show us and tell us about his characters. Still, the heart of this novella is its transformative message about the power of giving, a compelling theme that calls to mind books like Pay It Forward and The Kingdom Assignment.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Raiders and traders, settlers and craftsmen, the medieval Scandinavians who have become familiar to history as Vikings never lose their capacity to fascinate, from their ingeniously designed longboats to their stormy pantheon of Viking gods and goddesses, ruled by Odin in Valhalla. Robert Ferguson is a sure guide across what he calls "the treacherous marches which divide legend from fact in Viking Age history." His long familiarity with the literary culture of Scandinavia with its skaldic poetry is combined with the latest archaeological discoveries to reveal a sweeping picture of the Norsemen, one of history's most amazing civilizations.<br><br>Impeccably researched and filled with compelling accounts and analyses of legendary Viking warriors and Norse mythology, <i>The Vikings</i> is an indispensable guide to medieval Scandinavia and is a wonderful companion to the History Channel series.<br><br>"Integrating archaeological, genetic, linguistic, and literary information, Ferguson realizes a Viking history bound to satisfy." -<i>Booklist</i></p><p><b>Robert Ferguson</b> began his literary career as a radio dramatist, translating and adapting for radio works by Knut Hamsun and Henrik Ibsen for the BBC. His first literary biography was Enigma: The Life of Knut Hamsun, which was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Best Biography Award. As well as literary biographies, Ferguson has written two novels, published in Norwegian. <b><br></b>Sporting monikers such as Sven Forkbeard and Harald Bluetooth, the Vikings left arresting traces in saga and chronicle, in addition to their signature destruction and massacre. Ferguson synthesizes Viking scholarship for a general audience and follows the Vikings wherever they went. Spreading from Scandinavia, they entered written records as a result of raids on Britain and Ireland in the late 700s; soon the divisive Carolingian empire, and the land that would become Russia, would experience the Viking scourge as well. But along with slaves and booty came the encounter with Christianity, among whose proselytizers numbered the fearless believers who brought the Gospel to worshippers of Odin and Thor. The pagan-Christian interface informs Ferguson&#x2019;s narrative, and by emphasizing experiences of the conversion process by identifiable individuals within a centuries-long direction of Vikings forsaking their old religion, the author textures the pillage that he asserts is necessary to a complete understanding of the Viking age. Integrating archaeological, genetic, linguistic, and literary information, Ferguson realizes a Viking history bound to satisfy the interested reader. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Fire Bound (A Sea Haven Novel)</h2><p><b>A woman possesses the power to inflame the most dangerous passions of all in this Sisters of the Heart novel from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christine Feehan.<br><br></b><i>On the shores of Sea Haven, six women touched by great loss have come together in a sisterhood strengthened by the elements&#x2014;a bond each will need as new love and danger enter their lives...<br><br></i>Flame-haired Lissa Piner is a skilled glass blower whose delicate gift conceals a burning inner strength that can destroy as exquisitely as it can create.

The usual explanation has been to assume the one-time existence of land bridges (such as the hypothetical Lemuria) or parallelisms or diffusion with lost intermediary steps.<br>In 1915, however, one of the most influential and most controversial books in the history of science provided a new solution. This was Alfred Wegener's <i>Entstehung der Kontinente</i>, which dispensed with land bridges and parallel evolutions and offered a more economical concept. Wegener proposed that in the remote past the earth's continents were not separate (as now), but formed one supercontinent which later split apart, the fragments gradually drifting away from one another. Wegener created his supercontinent with attractive simplicity by tucking the point of South America into the Gulf of Guinea, coalescing North America, Greenland, and Europe, rotating Australia and Antarctica up through the Indian Ocean, and closing the remaining gaps. Wegener then explained various phenomena in historical geology, geomorphy, paleontology, paleoclimatology, and similar areas of science in terms of this continental drift. To back up his revolutionary theory he drew upon a seemingly inexhaustible find of data. Later editions of his book added new data to refute his opponents or to strengthen his own views in the violent scientific quarrel that arose.<br>Even today this important question remains undecided, and geologists are divided into strongly opposed groups about the Wegener hypothesis. At the moment it seems to be gaining steadily in acceptance. It is one of the two basic theories of earth history, and since it has often been misrepresented in summary, every earth scientist owes it to himself to examine its theories and data.</p><p></p></p><p>Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German scientist, geophysicist and meteorologist. He is most notable for his 1912 theory of continental drift, which was not accepted until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as paleomagnetism confirmed his hypothesis.</p><h2>Crazy Sexy Kitchen: 150 Plant-Empowered Recipes to Ignite a Mouthwatering Revolution</h2><p>In Crazy Sexy Kitchen, the woman who made prevention hot is now making it delicious!

This fascinating book helps us reclaim our innate capacity for joy, fun, exuberance, curiosity, and humor, while showing how reaching our sexual potential makes us smarter, happier, and more productive people. Ultimately, it reveals how a new understanding of sex can lead to a more expansive experience of pleasure in all aspects of our lives.</p><p>Dr. Nan Wise is a cognitive neuroscientist, professor, licensed psychotherapist, certified sex therapist, board-certified clinical hypnotherapist, and certified relationship specialist with three decades of experience. After almost twenty years in clinical practice as a sex therapist, she became driven by an intense desire to understand how the brain operates to create moods and behaviors in relation to sex and other aspects of human experience.

And remarkably, it still sounds as fresh and challenging today as it did upon its release in 1967. In this book, Joe Harvard covers everything from Lou Reed's lyrical genius to John Cale's groundbreaking instrumentation, and from the creative input of Andy Warhol to the fine details of the recording process. With input from co-producer Norman Dolph and Velvets fan Jonathan Richman, Harvard documents the creation of a record which - in the eyes of many - has never been matched.</p><p>In 1966, some studios, like Abbey Road, had technicians in white lab coats, and even the less formal studios usually had actual engineering graduates behind the consoles. Studios were still more about science than art. Clients who dared make technical suggestions were treated with bemusement, derision, or hostility. The Velvets were a young band under constant critical attack, and the pressure to conform in order to gain acceptance must have been tremendous. Most bands of that era compromised with their record companies, through wholesale revamping of their image from wardrobe to musical style, changing or omitting lyrics, creating drastically edited versions for radio airplay, or eliminating songs entirely from their sets and records.

She&#x2019;s never shown me anything but love, although she&#x2019;s tempered it by criticism perhaps once too often. She believes in me, I think, although she&#x2019;s not exactly averse to pointing out that I&#x2019;d be better off if I did things her way. She&#x2019;s a kind, generous person. At least, that is, to those she doesn&#x2019;t consider to be in competition with her for some vaguely defined goal, or else watch out&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll carry a grudge to the grave. She may be stiff and formal and sometimes overly concerned with the observance of proper behavior, but she&#x2019;s also adventurous and well traveled. And above all, her love of her children knows no bounds.</p><p>I do love my mother.</p><p>I just wish she weren&#x2019;t bearing down on me at this moment, face beaming, arms outstretched.</p><p>&#x201c;Surprise, darling!&#x201d; she cried.</p><p>It was a surprise all right. My heart sank into my stomach and I forced out a smile of my own. I&#x2019;d been living in the Outer Banks of North Carolina for a short time, making a new life for myself away from the social respectability of my parents&#x2019; circle in Boston, and here she was.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mom,&#x201d; I said as I was enveloped in a hug. It was a real hug, too. Hearty and all-embracing, complete with vigorous slaps on the back. When it came to her children, Mom allowed herself to forget she was a Boston society matron. I loved her for that, too.</p><p>I pulled myself out of the embrace. &#x201c;What are you doing here, Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come for a short vacation and to see how you&#x2019;re settling in.&#x201d; She lifted her arms to indicate not only the Outer Banks but the Lighthouse Library, where I worked and lived. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this charming? I haven&#x2019;t been in this building since it was renovated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were here before it became a library?&#x201d; I asked with some astonishment. When the historic Bodie Island Lighthouse had no longer been needed for its original function as a manually operated light, it had slowly crumbled into disrepair. Then, in a stroke of what I considered absolute genius, it was renovated and turned into a public library. High above, the great first-order Fresnel lens flashed in the night to guide ships at sea, while down below books were read and cherished.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I was,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;Oh, I can remember some wild nights, let me tell you. Sneaking around in the dark, trying to break into the lighthouse. Up to all sorts of mischief.&#x201d; She must have read something in my face. &#x201c;I was young once, Lucy. Although it sometimes seems like another lifetime.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked so dejected all of a sudden that I reached out and touched her arm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must be Mrs. Richardson.&#x201d; Ronald, one of my colleagues, extended his hand. He was a short man in his midforties with a shock of curly white hair. He wore blue-and-red-striped Bermuda shorts, a short-sleeved denim shirt, and a colorful tie featuring the antics of Mickey Mouse. &#x201c;The resemblance is remarkable,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Although if I hadn&#x2019;t heard Lucy call you Mom, I&#x2019;d have thought you were sisters.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom beamed. I didn&#x2019;t mind being told I looked thirty years older than I was; really I didn&#x2019;t. Ronald was our children&#x2019;s librarian, and a nice man with a warm, generous heart. He&#x2019;d only told Mom what she wanted to hear. And, I had to admit, Mom looked mighty darn good. Weekly spa visits, a personal trainer, regular tennis games, and the consumption of truckloads of serums and creams (and, perhaps, a tiny nip and tuck here and there) only accented her natural beauty. She was dressed in a navy blue Ralph Lauren blazer over a blindingly white T-shirt and white capris. Her carefully cut and dyed ash-blond hair curled around her chin, and small hoop earrings were in her ears. Her gold jewelry was, as always, restrained, but spoke of money well spent.</p><p>I, on the other hand, looked like the harassed librarian I was. Only the horn-rimmed glasses on a lanyard and a gray bun at the back of my head were missing. My unruly mop of dark curls had been pulled back into a ragged ponytail this morning, because I hadn&#x2019;t gotten up in time to wash it. I wore my summer work outfit of black pants cut slightly above the ankle, ballet flats, and a crisp blue short-sleeved shirt, tucked out. I hadn&#x2019;t gotten around to washing the shirt after the last time I&#x2019;d worn it, and hoped there were no stains so tiny I hadn&#x2019;t noticed&#x2014;because Mom would. I made the introductions. &#x201c;Suzanne Richardson, meet Ronald Burkowski, the best children&#x2019;s librarian in the state.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My pleasure,&#x201d; Mom said, before turning her attention back to me. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you give me the grand tour, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working right now.&#x201d;</p><p>She waved her hand at that trifle.</p><p>&#x201c;You go ahead, Lucy,&#x201d; Ronald said. &#x201c;My next group doesn&#x2019;t start for fifteen minutes. I&#x2019;ll watch the shop while you take your mom around the place. But,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t go upstairs yet. I want to show her the children&#x2019;s library myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom laughed, charmed. Ronald smiled back, equally charmed.</p><p>I refrained from rolling my eyes as she slipped her arm though mine. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you the Austen books, and then introduce you to my boss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is he as delightful as your Ronald?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not my Ronald, and Bertie is a she.&#x201d; I liked Bertie very much, but if there was one thing she was not, it was delightful.</p><p>I proudly escorted Mom to view the Bodie Island Lighthouse Library&#x2019;s pride and joy: a complete set of Jane Austen first editions. The six books, plus Miss Austen&#x2019;s own notebook, were on loan to us for a few more weeks this summer. They rested in a tabletop cabinet handcrafted specifically to hold them, tucked into a small alcove lit by a soft white light. The exhibit had proved to be successful beyond the wildest dreams of Bertie and the library board. Not to mention the local craftspeople and business owners when crowds of eager literary tourists began flooding into the Nags Head area.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to have a peek at Jane Austen&#x2019;s notebook,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;Written in her own handwriting&#x2014;imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get the key when we meet Bertie. I&#x2019;m sure we can make an exception in your case and let you hold it.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d learned the hard way to keep the cabinet locked at all times and to secure the only copy of the key on Bertie&#x2019;s person. She&#x2019;d told me that if the library caught fire in the night, I had permission to break the glass and grab the books. Otherwise, only she could open it.</p><p>Bertie was in her office, chewing on the end of a pencil as she studied her computer screen. I gave the open door a light tap. Bertie looked up, obviously pleased at the interruption. I knew she was going over the budget this morning. Charles, another of our staff members, occupied the single visitor&#x2019;s chair. He stretched lazily and gave Mom the once-over.</p><p>Neither he nor Mom appeared to be at all impressed with what they saw.</p><p>The edges of Charles&#x2019;s mouth turned up into the slightest sneer and he rubbed at his face. Then, very rudely, he went back to his nap.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Mom said, &#x201c;a cat. How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nice.&#x201d;</p><p>Bertie got to her feet and came out from behind her desk. I made the introductions, and the women shook hands.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re taking care of my only daughter,&#x201d; Mom said. Behind her back, I rolled my eyes. Bertie noticed, but she didn&#x2019;t react.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucy&#x2019;s taking care of us. She&#x2019;s a joy to work with and I consider myself, and the library, very lucky to have her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom smiled in the same way she had at parent-teacher interview day.</p><p>I&#x2019;m thirty years old and have a master&#x2019;s in library science, but to Mom I&#x2019;m still twelve and being praised for getting an A plus on my essay on the Bront� sisters. I felt myself smiling. In that, she was probably no different from most mothers.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you staying with Ellen?&#x201d; Bertie asked, referring to Mom&#x2019;s sister.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Ocean Side.&#x201d; Mom always stayed at the Ocean Side, one of the finest (and most expensive) hotels on this stretch of the coast. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been to the hotel yet, Lucy. I wanted to stop by and let you know I&#x2019;ve arrived. Why don&#x2019;t you come with me and help me check in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working,&#x201d; I said. Work was a concept Mom pretended to be unfamiliar with.</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead, Lucy,&#x201d; Bertie said. &#x201c;Take the rest of the afternoon off. You&#x2019;ve been putting in so many extra hours&#x2014;you deserve it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the circulation desk.&#x201d;</p><p>Between Mom&#x2019;s wanting me to come with her and Bertie&#x2019;s wanting to escape budget drudgery, I could hardly say no, now, could I?</p><p>Not wanting to be left alone, Charles roused himself and leapt off the chair. He rubbed himself against Mom&#x2019;s leg. She tried to unobtrusively push him away. Charles didn&#x2019;t care to be pushed., He was a big cat. A gorgeous Himalayan with a mass of tan-and-white fur, pointy ears, and a mischievous tan-and-white face. We walked down the hallway, while Mom tried not to trip over the animal weaving between her feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you drive all the way down today?&#x201d; I asked. Mom loved to drive, and she&#x2019;d often jump into her car and take off for a few days, giving the family no notice. &#x201c;Me time&#x201d; or &#x201c;road trip,&#x201d; she called it. As I got older, I began to realize that &#x201c;me time&#x201d; usually corresponded with my dad&#x2019;s dark moods.</p><p>&#x201c;I spent a couple of days in New York, left there this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;New York,&#x201d; Bertie said, almost dreamily. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been there for ages. How was it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Marvelous,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;I did some shopping, saw a play.&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed my bag from the staff break room, leaving Mom and Bertie to talk about the delights to be found in New York City.</p><p>When I reappeared, Ronald had joined the conversation. He was from New York and had been a professional actor before giving that up to become a librarian. Broadway&#x2019;s loss, I thought. Ronald loved nothing more than putting on dramatic presentations with the kids. Ronald&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s programs were one of the most popular things at the Lighthouse Library.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d enjoy showing you what we&#x2019;ve done with what little space we have, Suzanne,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you have time, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, I do,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on vacation after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You go on up,&#x201d; Bertie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the desk and then show Suzanne the notebook.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom linked her arm though Ronald&#x2019;s. The children&#x2019;s library is on the second level. We climbed up the spiral iron stairs, while Charles ran ahead, leaping nimbly from side to side and balancing perfectly on the railing, his huge bushy tail held high.</p><p>The children&#x2019;s room was a riot of color and soft fabrics. The space was small, but Ronald had divided it into sections: primary-color beanbags for sitting on, stuffed animals and cartoon characters, and bright plastic tables for the little children; pastel shades and sports team posters for the preteens; darker colors, larger chairs, and big maps on the walls for the teenagers. A scale model of an eighteenth-century sailing ship sat in the deep alcove of the room&#x2019;s single window, overlooking the sea.</p><p>Mom clapped her hands. &#x201c;This is marvelous. I have to bring my grandchildren here one day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d be more than welcome,&#x201d; Ronald said, clearly pleased by her enthusiasm.</p><p>&#x201c;Has anyone seen&#x2014; Oh, sorry. Didn&#x2019;t know you had company.&#x201d; The fourth member of our library team, Charlene, came into the room. Tiny blue buds were stuck in her ears and a cord ran down to disappear into her pocket. Charlene was our reference librarian, and when she was working, she enjoyed listening to music. What she considered music, anyway.</p><p>I made the introductions.</p><p>&#x201c;You drove all the way down from Boston by yourself?&#x201d; Charlene said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite a trip. What do you do when you&#x2019;re driving?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will you look at the time?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Better be off, Mom. Thanks for the tour, Ronald.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom gave me a questioning look. As well she might, but she&#x2019;d be grateful to me later if I could get her out of here. Charlene was hugely intelligent, a hard worker, and an absolute darling. I adored her, but for some totally unfathomable reason her passion in life was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;I can lend you some CDs if you&#x2019;d like, Suzanne. I find that you can really get into new music when you&#x2019;re alone on the open road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be nice of you,&#x201d; Mom said.</p><p>&#x201c;Only on the condition, of course,&#x201d; Charlene said with a grin, &#x201c;that you write back and tell me which ones you liked the best and what you&#x2019;d like to hear from my collection next. I&#x2019;ll start you off with Nicki Minaj and maybe Kanye West.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Mom said in all innocence.</p><p>Charlene&#x2019;s passion in life was hip-hop and rap music. Nothing wrong with that. Except for the fact that she was on a mission to convert the rest of us. No amount of protest could persuade her that we weren&#x2019;t on the verge of conversion.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll run and make a list of what you might like right now,&#x201d; Charlene said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring the CDs in tomorrow.&#x201d; She darted out of the room, clearly delighted to have found a willing subject. Mom was so polite that she would make an attempt to listen to the records. And then she&#x2019;d feel obliged to write to Charlene with her thanks. Thus opening the floodgate of further recommendations.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doomed,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Nicky who?&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;Is that the young Estonian concert violinist everyone&#x2019;s raving about?&#x201d;</p><p>Ronald swallowed a laugh.</p><p>Footsteps pounded on the stairs and two girls burst into the library, followed by their mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Phoebe. Dallas,&#x201d; Ronald said. &#x201c;Great to see you.&#x201d; The younger girl dived into the pile of beanbags, while the older dropped to a crouch to examine the rows of books.</p><p>&#x201c;Ronald,&#x201d; the woman said, &#x201c;I have a bone to pick with you.&#x201d; She paid Mom and me not the slightest bit of attention. The look on my mother&#x2019;s face was priceless. Suzanne Wyatt Richardson was not accustomed to being ignored.</p><p>&#x201c;What would that be, Mrs. Peterson?&#x201d; Ronald asked sweetly.</p><p>&#x201c;Chris Bernfoot had the nerve to tell me that you recommended a <i>seventh-grade</i> book to her Madison. Madison&#x2019;s six months younger than Phoebe. If she is reading seventh-grade material, then why isn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I gestured to Mom and headed for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;That was incredibly rude,&#x201d; Mom said as we descended the stairs. &#x201c;Do you know that frightful woman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes. Mrs. Peterson is one of our most regular patrons. She is a devoted and doting mother to her five daughters. Devoted, I might add, to the exclusion of everyone and everything else in the world. She takes it as a personal affront when Ronald spends time with any other kids.&#x201d; Despite their mother&#x2019;s excessive attention, the five Peterson daughters were growing up to be great girls. I figured Ronald had a lot to do with that.</p><p>More running, laughing children passed us on the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you like the children&#x2019;s library?&#x201d; Bertie asked Mom.</p><p>&#x201c;Totally delightful,&#x201d; Mom said.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, let me show you our pride and joy. Although only temporary, I fear.&#x201d; Bertie unlocked the Austen cabinet with great flourish. I handed Mom the white gloves used to handle the valuable books, and indicated she could pick up the notebook. It was, of course, a precious and fragile thing, about four inches square and an inch thick, with a faded and worn leather cover. Mom opened the book. The hand was small, the writing faded ...</p></p><h2>Love and Awakening: Discovering the Sacred Path of Intimate Relationship</h2><p>Unlike other guides that focus on how to make relationships work, this groundbreaking book teaches couples how their relationships can make their lives work. Combining the practical advice of Harville Hendrix with the spiritual guidance of Thomas Moore, it shows couples how their relationships can help them discover their sacred selves in such chapters as "The Power of Truth-Telling", "The Inner Marriage", "Men In Relationship" and "Soulwork and Sacred Combat". Along the way, it provides a wealth of practical guidance on how to deal with difficult problems and includes lively dialogues from Welwood's workshops that dynamically illustrate his core ideas. <p> Men and women are searching for deeper meaning and purpose in their everyday lives and relationships. <em>Love and Awakening</em> fills this need. It is a book couples will want to read together.</p></p><p>Combining practical advice (like that of Harville Hendrix) with spiritual teachings (like those of Thomas Moore), John Welwood, psychotherapist and author of the bestselling <i>Journey of the Heart</i>, creates an extraordinary new book about the sacred power of intimate relationships."A soul connection is a resonance between two people who see each other's essential beauty, behind their facades, and who connect on this deeper level. This kind of mutual recognition provides the catalyst for a potent alchemy. It is a sacred alliance whose purpose is to help both partners discover and realize their deepest potentials." Men and women are searching for deeper meaning and purpose in their everyday lives and in their relationships. In his groundbreaking new book, <i>Love and Awakening</i>, which takes up where his best-seller <i>Journey of the Heart</i> left off, renowned author and psychotherapist John Welwood, Ph.D., points the way. He shows how intimate relationship is a powerful spiritual teacher that can help two people discover their deepest capacities and resources, while learning to relate to each other in a more honest, enriching, and enlivening way. <p> Starting out by addressing the question that inevitably arises in every relationship-- "What am I doing here, is this really worth the struggle?"-- <i>Love and Awakening</i> sets forth a compelling new paradigm of relationship as a path of soulwork. Welwood shows how every psychological obstacle arising between two lovers provides a special kind of spiritual opportunity-- to tap into hidden inner resources and go deeper with each other. The book offers not only a new vision, but also a wealth of practical guidance to help couples work with their most difficult problems, through learning to relate to the whole range of their experience with greater awareness and loving-kindness. Also included are lively dialogues from Welwood's relationship workshops that dynamically illustrate the book's core ideas and demonstrate simple, direct ways to connect more deeply with oneself and one's partner. Written in a poetic style that remains faithful to the spirit of love, with chapters ranging from "Soulwork and Sacred Combat" and "The Power of Truth-Telling," to "The Inner Marriage" and "Men in Relationship," this book will compel and inspire readers to approach their relationships in a whole new way. As two people learn to let their love awaken them from the frozen habits of past conditioning, they embark on the path of "conscious relationship." <i>Love and Awakening</i> is about much more than just making a relationship work; it's about how a relationship can make one's whole life work in a richer, more deeply satisfying way.</p></p><h2>Unspeakable (2) (Tracers)</h2><p><b>ELAINA MCCORD WANTS TO FIND A KILLER.

She shoved open the car door and got out, sighing at the faint stirring of air. Not a breeze, exactly, but not too far off. For a moment, she stood beside the Taurus to get her bearings.<br><br>She scooped her hair off her neck and twisted it into some semblance of a bun. Her poly-blend Filene&#x2019;s Basement pantsuit concealed her holster but didn&#x2019;t breathe. She should have sprung for something silk, but when she&#x2019;d purchased her career wardrobe, she&#x2019;d been thinking D.C. or New York. In a million years she never would have guessed she&#x2019;d end up in Brownsville, Texas&#x2014;a satellite of a satellite office, a thousand miles from anywhere she wanted to be.<br><br>Except today.<br><br>Today Lito Island Police Chief Matt Breck had called Brownsville to request federal assistance in solving a string of homicides. Most likely he was expecting a pair of veteran agents in crew cuts and dark suits.<br><br>Instead, he was getting a rookie in a Donna Karan knockoff.<br><br>Elaina smoothed her lapels and gathered her determination. She slammed the door shut, locked the car, and hiked up half a dozen wooden steps so a cardboard sign could tell her what she already knew.<br><br>The place was deserted.<br><br>BE BACK SOON. The black hands on the clock had been positioned for ten-thirty. Elaina glanced up at the sun blazing directly down on top of her. She cupped her hand and peered through the tinted glass door to the darkened offices beyond. The place looked to be shut down.<br><br>Who shuts down a police station?<br><br>What the hell planet was this?<br><br>Elaina huffed out a breath and turned around. Beyond the minuscule lot, a row of tall palm trees bordered Highway 106, otherwise known as Lito Highway because it was the only highway in town and ran the entire twenty-two-mile length of the island. The first two miles, Elaina had discovered, were crammed with motels, restaurants, and surf shops. The last twenty miles consisted of God only knew what. From the map, it looked as though the road disappeared into the Lito Island Wildlife Refuge just south of town. She turned her gaze that way now and saw grass and water and what looked like never-ending acres of swamp.<br><br>Or estuary. Whatever.<br><br>A weathered wooden deck surrounded the dormant police station, and Elaina followed it around to the back, taking care not to let her low black heels catch on the uneven slats. The white adobe station house reflected the sun like a mirror. It backed up to Laguna Madre, the bay that separated Lito from the mainland. Elaina averted her gaze from the glare as she made her way to the back of the building. A speck of movement on the water caught her eye.<br><br>A boat. Moving in her direction, too, which meant it was either heading toward the police dock or the cleverly named Lito Island Marina just next door.<br><br>The boat drew nearer. Some sort of official logo marked the side of it, and Elaina counted at least four passengers standing behind whoever was at the helm. Her stomach tightened as she thought about the fifth passenger, whom she knew would be lying on the floor.<br><br>The boat zipped past the police dock before making a wide turn and gliding up to the marina. The wake splashed up through the wooden slats, soaking Elaina&#x2019;s shoes.<br><br>Water squished through her toes as she picked her way across the thick carpet of Saint Augustine grass separating the station house from the marina. SUVs and pickups crammed the gravel lot. She spotted two police units and a red Suburban with LIFD painted on the side.<br><br>Elaina ducked around the side of the corrugated metal building, passing a leathery man toting an empty crab trap, then a pair of teenagers carrying yellow bait buckets. Next to a humming Coke machine, a man stood smoking a cigarette and watching her. She passed a wooden fish sink and a balding, bearded guy who paused in the act of hacking off a fish head to stare at her. Ignoring all the curious gazes, Elaina focused on the end of the pier.<br><br>The boat&#x2019;s captain&#x2014;Chief Breck?&#x2014;barked out an order, and a man in a khaki uniform hopped down from the vessel to tie the bowline to a cleat.<br><br>Two uniformed men bent down in unison and lifted something off the boat&#x2019;s floor. Elaina watched, shocked, as they manhandled the long black bundle onto the pier, where they laid it out in the sun. Finally, the captain disembarked.<br><br>Elaina strode forward. &#x201c;Chief Breck?&#x201d;<br><br>His gaze shot up and turned instantly suspicious beneath the bill of his LIPD cap. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped before him and looked up at the guarded expression in his brown eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;I got no comment at this time,&#x201d; he stated.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re with the <i>Herald,</i> right?&#x201d; His gaze skimmed over her suit, pausing on her wet cuffs, then snapped back up to her face. &#x201c;Or maybe you&#x2019;re TV? Either way, I got no comment as of yet, so &#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m with the FBI.&#x201d; Elaina thrust out her hand. &#x201c;Special Agent Elaina McCord.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyebrows popped up, disappearing beneath the hat.<br><br>&#x201c;You called Brownsville this morning?&#x201d; she reminded him as his baffled gaze dropped to her hand. &#x201c;Requested assistance?&#x201d;<br><br>His brow furrowed now, and Elaina gave up on the handshake. He looked her over once again. She peered around him at the body bag laid out on the dock. A white-haired man in street clothes stood beside it. The ME?<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you step on over there?&#x201d; Breck gestured back toward the building. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;ll be with you in a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina gritted her teeth but complied with his request by stepping back a few paces. It wouldn&#x2019;t be wise to piss off the police chief in her first homicide investigation. She crossed her arms and looked on as Breck turned his back on her and exchanged words with his officers.<br><br>Smoke wafted over to her. Elaina glanced at the Coke machine, where the man with the cigarette still stood, his shoulder propped casually against the door frame. Something about his steady, penetrating look gave her goose bumps.<br><br>She glanced away.<br><br>A flurry of feathers erupted as the man at the sink tossed some guts into the water and the seagulls scrambled. A giant brown pelican flapped over to snatch away the prize, then perched on the dock as he gobbled it down.<br><br>Elaina glanced around, taking mental notes. The teenagers had disappeared but the crabber still lurked nearby, his arms folded over his chest and his trap at his feet while his attention remained fixed on the body bag. Elaina memorized his face, then scanned the rest of the area for suspects. Some perps liked to hang around and observe the aftermath of what they&#x2019;d done. Elaina counted nine spectators at the moment, including a shirtless, sun-baked twenty-something with blond dreadlocks. He had his arm draped over a young woman&#x2019;s shoulders, and they watched the end of the pier with morbid fascination.<br><br>Elaina checked her watch. She cursed under her breath. Breck and his men stood huddled on the dock, shooting the nonexistent breeze. Elaina felt her temperature rising as the minutes ticked by and the sun glared down.<br><br>A large brown bird alighted at the end of the pier and wobbled over on spindly legs to check out the body bag, jabbing at the plastic with a sickle-shaped beak.<br><br>Elaina shot past the men and waved her arms. &#x201c;Shoo! Shoo!&#x201d; she yelled, and the bird took off.<br><br>She whirled around. &#x201c;<i>Where</i> is the body-removal team?&#x201d;<br><br>Breck frowned at her. &#x201c;The who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The body-removal team! She&#x2019;s baking in there, along with whatever evidence we might recover.&#x201d;<br><br>Breck&#x2019;s hands went to his hips. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re waiting on our ambulance. They got hung up with some sorta accident down at the beach.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina took a deep breath. She felt dozens of eyes boring into her as she straightened her shoulders and tried to calm down.<br><br>&#x201c;When will it be here?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;When it gets here. Maynard.&#x201d; Breck jerked his head toward one of the uniforms.<br><br>&#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go take Miss McCord over to the station house to cool her jets.&#x201d;<br><br>They left her waiting for more than four hours.<br><br>Elaina refused to acknowledge the snub. Instead, she retrieved her briefcase from her car, along with her cell phone. She spread her files out across the conference room table and worked diligently, as if she&#x2019;d gotten up this morning with every intention of spending her Friday afternoon in some backwater police station. By five-thirty, though, her patience was gone. She was hungry and tired. And sticky, too, as the room had no air-conditioning&#x2014; only a portable fan that circulated the same warm air, over and over. She was about to get up to search for a vending machine when the door popped open. Officer Maynard again.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss McCord? The chief&#x2019;ll see you now.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally, an audience with His Highness. Elaina collected her manila file folders and shoved them into her briefcase.<br><br>&#x201c;Right this way, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>Maynard was shorter than she was, probably five-nine. But he had a trim build and rigid posture that reminded her of the Marines she&#x2019;d crossed paths with during her twenty-two weeks at Quantico. He led her through the wood-paneled police station and past a sixtyish woman seated at a metal desk beside one of the offices. She was talking on the phone and writing on a pad, a stack of pink message slips piled at her elbow.<br><br>Maynard opened the door to the inner sanctum of Breck&#x2019;s office, and Elaina stepped inside. The room smelled faintly of cigars, and the chief sat in a padded leather chair behind a faux wood desk. Arranged in a semicircle around the desk were plastic chairs occupied by people she&#x2019;d seen earlier at the marina, with the exception of a bald man who held a cowboy hat in his hand. The star pinned to his chest told Elaina he was a Texas Ranger.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Frank Cisernos,&#x201d; the white-haired man from the dock said, standing up. &#x201c;County Medical Examiner.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina shook his hand and introduced herself. She darted her gaze around to the other faces. The young Latino officer smiled at her, but no one else rose to greet her.<br><br>Maynard took one of the two empty chairs and gestured for Elaina to take the other. She deposited her briefcase in it and remained standing, then laced her fingers together in front of her so no one would see that she was trembling.<br><br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re here to lend us a hand.&#x201d; Breck leaned forward on his elbows. &#x201c;Scarborough tells me you&#x2019;re fresh from the Academy.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina tried not to wince. &#x201c;I graduated last fall.&#x201d; She wondered what else the supervisory special agent had told him. Her boss made no secret of his dislike for her, but he&#x2019;d finally given her a shot at criminal profiling. Maybe he was coming around.<br><br>Or maybe he&#x2019;d sent her here to fall on her face.<br><br>She cleared her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to provide a criminal profile. Also, I&#x2019;m authorized to offer FBI assistance with any labs you need.&#x201d; She glanced at the Texas Ranger&#x2014;who also probably had the clout to fast-track lab work&#x2014;and knew her stock was sinking quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;A profile, huh?&#x201d; Breck leaned back in his chair now. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna tell us about our unsub?&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone&#x2019;s attention settled on Elaina.<br><br>&#x201c;What I have on our subject is preliminary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to see photos from this morning&#x2019;s crime scene and I&#x2019;ll need to observe the autopsy. I understand someone from the state crime lab&#x2019;s coming down to assist?&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced at Cisernos, who gave a slight nod.<br><br>&#x201c;And do we know the victim&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing confirmed,&#x201d; Breck said. &#x201c;But for the past half hour, I&#x2019;ve had just about every parent whose college kid is down here ringing my phone off the hook. They all heard about the body on the news. Now their daughter&#x2019;s not answering her cell, and they want to know if it&#x2019;s her or not.<br><br>&#x201c;So go on ahead.&#x201d; Breck nodded. &#x201c;Tell us your profile.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said &#x2018;nothing confirmed,&#x2019;&#x201d; Elaina replied, sidestepping the bear trap. &#x201c;You mean you have a lead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All I&#x2019;ve got for sure is Caucasian female, long dark hair.&#x201d; Breck eyed Elaina&#x2019;s long dark hair as he said this. Then he glanced down at the yellow legal pad on his desk. &#x201c;She was a mess&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t even tell her age. But we took a call this afternoon about an abandoned Audi sedan at a boat slip on the north side of town. Car&#x2019;s been there two days. It&#x2019;s registered to Valerie Monroe, twenty-seven-year-old from Houston. There&#x2019;s a purse inside. Driver&#x2019;s license, med school ID, health insurance card. She&#x2019;s a brunette. Car&#x2019;s been impounded, but we still gotta process everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And my supervisor told me the victim was found in the marshes this morning by some fishermen.&#x201d; Elaina looked at the ME. &#x201c;She was naked and had been eviscerated, apparently, like Gina Calvert back in March?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gina Calvert was found March fifteenth,&#x201d; Cisernos said. &#x201c;By my estimation, she&#x2019;d been there at least two days. This new body looks about three days old to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Gina&#x2019;s body was also discovered in the wildlife park.&#x201d; Elaina&#x2019;s confidence returned as she ran through the facts of the case, which she&#x2019;d committed to memory months ago. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d been injected with ketamine hydrochloride. Her car was found abandoned at a boat slip. Her personal items were left inside.&#x201d;<br><br>Breck folded his arms over his chest. &#x201c;Okay, sounds like you&#x2019;ve done your homework, Miss McCord. So tell us about our perp. Who&#x2019;re we looking for?&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina&#x2019;s instincts screamed for her to stop. The prudent thing would be to wait until she had all her facts together. But her face felt warm, her armpits felt damp, and the air in the room was thick with skepticism.<br><br>She took a deep breath. &#x201c;I think the offender is a white male, late twenties to mid-thirties. I think he&#x2019;s bright, but he has an inflated sense of his own intelligence and he&#x2019;s driven by ego. He&#x2019;s most likely attractive, possibly charming, and comfortable approaching women with some kind of ploy. His sophisticated MO shows that he&#x2019;s organized and capable of controlling his impulses. I think he lives on the island, is underemployed, and owns or has easy access to a boat. His hobbies include hunting and fishing. He likes guns. I also think he&#x2019;s probably got some background in law enforcement.&#x201d;<br><br>She noticed the startled looks but kept going. &#x201c;No sign of sexual assault, at least nothing overt.&#x201d;<br><br>Breck&#x2019;s brows arched. &#x201c;Overt?&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina shifted slightly. &#x201c;Even without rape, I believe these are sex crimes. The knife work is a form of penetration. And this type of offender sometimes can&#x2019;t get an erection, so he substitutes something else.&#x201d;<br><br>Breck traded looks with the ranger, and Elaina plunged on so she wouldn&#x2019;t have to answer any questions yet.<br><br>&#x201c;He kidnaps these women, injects them with a chemical to incapacitate them, takes them to remote locations, and then makes a deep abdominal incision with a serrated hunting knife. He leaves almost no trace evidence behind, indicating a good deal of knowledge and planning&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, wait a minute there.&#x201d; Breck held up his hand. &#x201c;We only got two victims. You make it sound like we&#x2019;re dealing with a serial killer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe we are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It could be a copycat. Some domestic murder, staged to look like the girl from spring break, just to throw us off.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaina tipped her head to the side. &#x201c;And how many of those details were released to the media?&#x201d;<br><br>Breck darted an uneasy glance around the room, and she knew she&#x2019;d made a tactical mistake by challenging him in front of an audience.<br><br>But he recovered quickly. &#x201c;And we don&#x2019;t know what evidence he might have left i...</p><h2>Flossie and the Fox</h2><p>A wily fox, notorious for stealing eggs, meets his match when he encounters a bold little girl in the woods who insists upon proof that he is a fox before she will be frightened.</p><p>Rachel Isadora began dancing at the age of eight.

All rights reserved.Grade 1-3 McKissack recounts this story which was told to her as a child by her grandfather. Flossie is a young black girl who lives with her grandmother in the rural south. When Big Mama sends Flossie to deliver a basket of eggs to a neighbor, she cautions her to be careful of the fox who had been frightening the chickens and stealing their eggs. To Flossie's "How do a fox look?," Big Mama responds that "A fox be just a fox." Having no idea what this means, Flossie sets out on her mission through a wooded area, where she is greeted by the fox. As he tries to convince her that he is to be feared, she refutes him by insisting that he prove who he is. To readers' delight, the frustrated fox fails every attempt. Fox' final confrontation with a fierce dog saves the day for Flossie, who proves herself to be more cunning than the fox. The watercolor and ink illustrations, with realistic figures set on impressionistic backgrounds, enliven this humorous and well-structured story which is told in the black language of the rural south. The language is true, and the illustrations are marvelously complementary in their interpretation of the events. This spirited little girl will capture readers from the beginning, and they'll adore her by the end of this delightful story. Helen E.

How exactly does liturgical formation shape us? What are the dynamics of such transformation? In the second of James K. A. Smith's three-volume theology of culture, the author expands and deepens the analysis of cultural liturgies and Christian worship he developed in his well-received <i>Desiring the Kingdom</i>. He helps us understand and appreciate the bodily basis of habit formation and how liturgical formation--both "secular" and Christian--affects our fundamental orientation to the world. Worship "works" by leveraging our bodies to transform our imagination, and it does this through stories we understand on a register that is closer to body than mind. This has critical implications for how we think about Christian formation.<br><br>Professors and students will welcome this work as will pastors, worship leaders, and Christian educators. The book includes analyses of popular films, novels, and other cultural phenomena, such as <i>The King's Speech</i>, <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i>, David Foster Wallace's <i>Infinite Jest</i>, and Facebook.</p><p><b>A Liturgical Theology of Culture<br></b><br>"<i>Imagining the Kingdom</i> is a fit successor to Jamie Smith's remarkable <i>Desiring the Kingdom</i>. The new book is, like its predecessor, learned but lively, provocative but warmhearted, a manifesto and a guide. Smith takes Christians deeper into the artistic, imaginative, and practical resources on which we must draw if we wish to renew not only our minds but also our whole beings in Christ."<br>--<b>Alan Jacobs</b>, Honors College of Baylor University<br><br>"In this wonderfully rich and engagingly readable book of 'liturgical anthropology,' Smith makes a persuasive case for the thesis that human beings are best understood as worshiping animals. It has important implications at once for practical theology's reflection on religious formation, liturgy, and pedagogy and for philosophical theorizing about just what religion is. And it develops as an engaging and lively conversation among an astonishing mix of people: imagine Calvin, Proust, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, Wendell Berry, Bourdieu, and David Foster Wallace all in the same room really talking to each other about being human and how to think about it!"<br>--<b>David Kelsey</b>, Yale Divinity School<br><br>"Jamie Smith shows us that the gospel does not primarily happen between our ears but in all the movements of the body by which we are formed and in turn form the world. I know of no more thorough and sophisticated account of how secular liturgies form and deform us and how Christian liturgies can help. Though sophisticated, Smith's book is also a delight. Its pages are filled with great poetry and insights from films, novels, and everyday life."<br>--<b>William T. Cavanaugh</b>, DePaul University<br><br>"A thought-provoking, generative reflection on the imagination-shaping power of Christian worship practices. What an ideal book for crossing boundaries among academic disciplines and between the academy and the church."<br>--<b>John D. Witvliet</b>, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College, and Calvin Theological Seminary<br><br>"It is heartening to set one's eyes on Jamie Smith's bold and creative endeavor to awaken Christians, Protestants in particular, to the centrality of worship in even, nay especially, our moral lives. This thoughtful book is rightly concerned with a restoration of the Christian imagination rooted in habits of virtue."<br>--<b>Vigen Guroian</b>, University of Virginia<b>James K. A.

Along with a neurotic hooker girlfriend, this is the total sum of Vince's new life. But when a familiar face shows up in town, Vince realizes his sordid past is still too close behind him. During the next unforgettable week, he'll negotiate a coast-to-coast maze of obsessive cops, eager politicians, and assorted mobsters�only to find that redemption might exist, of all places, in the voting booth. </p></p><p><p>Jess Walter is the author of six novels, including the bestsellers <em>Beautiful Ruins</em> and <em>The Financial Lives of the Poets</em>, the National Book Award finalist <em>The Zero</em>, and <em>Citizen Vince</em>, the winner of the Edgar Award for best novel. His short fiction has appeared in <em>Harper's</em>, <em>McSweeney's</em>, and <em>Playboy</em>, as well as <em>The Best American Short Stories</em> and <em>The Best American Nonrequired Reading</em>. He lives in his hometown of Spokane, Washington.</p>It's October 1980, and laid-back loner Vince Camden never misses a morning making maple bars at the doughnut shop he manages in Spokane, Washington. And he rarely misses a night relieving locals of their bankrolls at an after-hours poker game, selling his hooker pals pot at cost, and running a lucrative credit-card theft ring. Vince has landed in eastern Washington via the witness-protection plan, and he is starting to like the simple pleasures, including receiving his first voter-registration card. So even when a hit man, a local cop, and Mob-boss-in-waiting John Gotti get Vince in their crosshairs, he keeps trying to figure out if he should pull the lever for Reagan or Carter. This tale of unlikely redemption works because of Walter's virtuoso command of character and dialogue--along with a wicked second-act twist. The novel is also a gritty love letter to Spokane and all the other second-tier cities where residents don't realize how good they've got it, and with its Capara-like spirit, it serves as a surprisingly satisfying antidote to the avalanche of cynical chatter emanating from this year's political campaigns and commentators. <i>Frank Sennett</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ideally, within a week, your doctor calls with the results, assuring you that they are normal. You may even receive a copy of the test in the mail, complete with columns of numbers supposedly confirming your health, but to you are probably meaningless and confusing. So you put the results aside, file them away with your other personal records, and carry on with your life free of concern. After all, the doctor says you are in the &#x201c;normal range,&#x201d; so why worry? While this may be the case, blood tests still raise important questions that even the healthiest of patients should be asking: Does &#x201c;normal&#x201d; necessarily mean &#x201c;healthy&#x201d;?<i> </i>What can the lab values of a blood test tell me about the current state of my health? And, perhaps more importantly, what can these lab values tell me about my health in the future?</p> <p>The fact is, blood testing generally has one purpose, and that is to check for disorders, dysfunction, and disease. When blood test results point to a certain condition, measures are taken to bring the appropriate number&#x2015;the abnormal lab value&#x2015;into the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; range. However, when test results are normal, only rarely is a patient told how to stay in this range or, better yet, how to achieve an optimal, or target, level. It becomes a matter of waiting for the other shoe to drop, leading up to the day when you walk into the doctor&#x2019;s office or pick up the phone and are told, &#x201c;You are diabetic&#x201d; or &#x201c;You have a thyroid disorder.&#x201d; But it does not have to be this way.</p> <p>A blood test is essentially a blueprint of your health and a glimpse of its future. It tells you so much about what is going on inside your body, and it can speak volumes about what <i>may </i>go on inside of it somewhere down the line. The information obtained from lab results can push you to take the needed steps to put (or keep) your health on the right track. A blood test can motivate you to change your dietary habits, start a fitness regimen, or alter certain aspects of your lifestyle, such as your stress level and sleep patterns. A blood test can also be precautionary, helping you to monitor conditions that may be a running concern in your family or personal medical history. If you are already being treated for a particular condition, a blood test is one of the best ways to ensure that your medication is doing its job. In sum, a blood test is a quantitative way of measuring your health so that you can manage it more effectively and easily. But before you can begin to interpret your test results, you should know a thing or two about the blood testing procedure, as well as certain factors that may influence the outcome.</p> <p><strong>[B] THE BASICS OF BLOOD TESTING</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>A <i>blood test </i>is a common medical procedure in which a small amount of blood is drawn from the body using a needle, which is usually inserted into a vein in the arm. The blood sample is then analyzed by a lab technician to check for any sign or risk of disease, organ dysfunction, nutritional deficiency, or other problem. The technician may examine whole blood or separate the blood cells from the fluid in which they are contained, which is known as the <i>serum</i> or <i>plasma</i>. The plasma is used to measure levels of various substances in the blood and determine whether or not they fall into the <i>normal range.</i> This range is based on the <i>average </i>values reported in 95 percent of healthy people of a certain group and, therefore, may vary according to factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity. The reference ranges for normal, high, and low lab values may vary among laboratories depending on the methodology used by the blood analysts. The ranges used in this book reflect the guidelines set by LabCorp, a company that provides testing services to nearly 90 percent of doctors&#x2019; offices, hospitals, and other medical institutions. (See the &#x201c;Resources&#x201d; section on page 000 for a listing of LabCorp reference ranges.) However, some labs may use slightly different ranges, so you should take this into account when reviewing your blood test results.</p> <p>Standard blood tests are not always completely accurate. There are a number of factors that may artificially cause your blood levels to fall outside the normal range, resulting in an abnormal reading or false-positive result. Certain foods, physical activity, alcohol and caffeine consumption, and some medications affect metabolism and overall body function, and thus may influence blood test results. Failing to follow pre-testing instructions, such as fasting, can also produce abnormal results. By the same token, standard blood tests can indicate normal blood levels when a disease or other condition is actually present, or a false-negative result. The bottom line is that abnormal results may, but do not always, indicate a health problem. If your results show an abnormality, do not panic. Your physician will probably recommend more specific blood tests, which have a higher rate of accuracy.</p> <p>In general, a blood test is quick and requires little preparation. If you are unfamiliar with the procedure or if it has been a long time since your last blood test, here is a rundown of what you can expect before, during, and after the test.</p> <p><strong>[C] Before the Blood Test</strong></p> <p>One of the most common questions people have about blood tests is whether or not they can eat beforehand. Most healthcare professionals recommend fasting for approximately eight hours prior to a blood test. To &#x201c;fast&#x201d; generally means to abstain from food and beverages, especially coffee, tea, and alcohol. These liquids in particular should not be in your system for ten to twelve hours before the test, as they can skew readings. However, fasting does not include water, which you should continue to drink not only to prevent dehydration, but also the lightheaded and dizzy feeling that may accompany the loss of even a small amount of blood. If your doctor or health practitioner does not mention fasting, it is best to ask, as it may be advisable to fast for more<i> </i>than eight hours to ensure the accuracy of certain tests.</p> <p>Pre-test preparations may also be tailored to a specific health concern, such as triglycerides or blood sugar. If you are worried that your triglycerides level is high, you may want to avoid fatty foods the day before the test, as these can artificially raise the fat content of your blood and cause a high reading. Even a seemingly harmless food such as salad dressing (unless it is fat-free) can inflate your triglycerides level. If you are concerned about high blood sugar, refrain from eating foods rich in carbohydrates the day before the test, since they remain in your system longer than other foods.</p> <p>Still, many of your blood levels will not change significantly in the short term, especially if your body is functioning normally. Fasting has the greatest impact on blood sugar, insulin, and triglycerides, so stay away from foods and liquids that can temporarily raise these levels. Keep in mind, though, that there are many blood tests that may require special preparation, so always inquire ahead of time about pre-testing instructions. Finally, be sure to tell your doctor or health practitioner if you are taking blood thinners, such as heparin and warfarin (Coumadin), or any other medication, whether prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC). Since medications may interfere with test results, your doctor should be aware of this information before the blood test is administered.</p> <p><strong>[C] During the Blood Test</strong></p> <p>Although self-testing kits are now available from online retailers, you should have your blood tested at a doctor&#x2019;s office, lab, or hospital. Drawing blood is not a foolproof procedure and, therefore, should be done by a <i>phlebotomist&#x2015;</i>a specialist trained in drawing blood samples for medical analysis. A skilled phlebotomist should be able to find a vein and draw the blood in a single attempt without causing a patient to feel significant pain or discomfort. Most people feel only a brief pinch when having their blood drawn. Of course, not all phlebotomists are equally skilled at finding veins or inserting needles, so if a vein cannot be found after two tries, you should ask that another technician take your blood instead.</p> <p>While blood tests are generally neither complicated nor painful, there are a couple things you can do immediately before the test to ensure the procedure is as comfortable and stress-free as possible. First, increase your water intake about an hour before the test, since water helps to fill up the veins, making them &#x201c;plumper&#x201d; and more easily accessible. Second, place a warm towel or heating pad on your arm as you sit in the waiting room. Like water, warmth makes veins less constricted so that the technician taking your blood can easily locate a vein and insert the needle, thereby minimizing discomfort.</p> <p>You will probably be sitting in a chair or on an examining table for the blood test. Once you are comfortable, the phlebotomist will apply a tourniquet and touch your arm with one or two fingers, feeling for a vein. You may be asked to make a fist to make the veins in your arm more prominent. When the vein is located, the area will be cleaned by applying rubbing alcohol with a cotton swab. Then, it is finally time to draw the blood.</p> <p>To reduce your anxiety, look away from the needle and focus on another object in the room, or simply close your eyes. Try to relax your arm and make sure you keep it still. Once the needle is in, the hardest part is over&#x2015;the test will be done in a matter of minutes.</p> <p><strong>[C] After the Blood Test</strong></p> <p>Once the needle has been withdrawn from your arm, you will probably be asked to bend your arm and apply pressure to the area while the phlebotomist gets a bandage. Let her know if you are sensitive or allergic to adhesive; you can instead be given a Co-Flex, which is gauze with a rubbery coating. Bandages, which can usually be removed within twenty-four hours, help to minimize bruising, though some people will bruise regardless. This is typically not a concern, but you should speak to your doctor or health practitioner if the bruise lasts for several days. In addition, remember to eat shortly after a blood test to replenish your system and energy. Many people bring a snack, such as a piece of fruit or beverage. At the very least, you should have water or even a glass of juice immediately after your blood is drawn.</p> <p>It usually does not take long to receive blood test results, especially if the test is administered at a lab. If it is performed at a doctor&#x2019;s office, you may have to wait three to five days for the results, since the blood sample has to be sent out to a lab for analysis. If your doctor or health practitioner does not contact you within a week, you should call and inquire about your results. Keep in mind, though, that most doctors will call right away if a problem is detected, so &#x201c;no news&#x201d; is often a good sign. Even so, it is very important that you are informed of the results and that a copy is mailed to you. This is usually done at the request of the patient, so be sure to ask.</p> <p>Upon receiving your blood test results, you should carefully review them. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough. Since &#x201c;your blood never lies,&#x201d; you should be able to understand what it is telling you. This book will be your interpreter and guide.</p> <p><strong>[B] HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</strong></p> <p><strong><i>Your Blood Never Lies </i></strong>is designed to be a comprehensive health guide that will enable you to not only understand your blood test results, but also how to improve them. But first you should understand how the book is organized, as well as be familiar with some of the information it contains.</p> <p><strong>[C] Understanding the Format</strong></p> <p><strong><i>Your Blood Never Lies </i></strong>is divided into six parts. The first five parts concentrate on specific groups of blood tests, including four traditional blood panels&#x2015;the lipid panel, the basic metabolic panel, the hepatic function panel, and the complete blood count&#x2015;as well as commonly administered hormone tests for both men and women. The last part of the book covers tests that, though optional, provide a more complete picture of health. In case you are unfamiliar with blood tests, here is a brief explanation of the labs discussed in this book:&nbsp;</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part One&#x2015;The Lipid Panel. </strong>Used to evaluate heart health, this panel is comprised of four biological markers representing the four types of fat (lipids) found in the blood&#x2015;triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Two additional measures of cardiovascular health, homocysteine and c-reactive protein (CRP), may also be measured as part of a more comprehensive profile. These two labs are discussed in Part Six, &#x201c;Optional Tests&#x201d; (see below).</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part Two&#x2015;The Basic Metabolic Panel. </strong>The labs used to evaluate metabolism represent blood sugar regulation, electrolyte and fluid balance, and kidney function. Biomarkers included in this panel are glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part Three&#x2015;The Hepatic Function Panel. </strong>This panel determines how well your liver is functioning by measuring levels of different proteins produced and processed by the liver, like albumin and globulin, as well as liver enzymes.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part Four&#x2015;The Complete Blood Count (CBC) Panel. </strong>The lab values measured in the complete blood count (CBC) panel include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. Maintaining healthy levels of these biomarkers affect your vitality and energy, immune system, and cardiovascular health.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part Five&#x2015;Hormones. </strong>Although they are not always included in a routine blood test, hormones should be periodically tested, especially in aging adults. Hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, DHEA, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) play an integral role in reproductive wellness and affect other aspects of health. Maintaining balanced levels can slow down the aging process, for instance. Hormones involved in metabolism, like the thyroid hormones and the stress hormone cortisol, are also discussed in this section.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Part Six&#x2015;Optional Tests. </strong>This final part of the book highlights four tests&#x2015;homocysteine, c-reactive protein (CRP), vitamin D, and magnesium&#x2015;that are not typically measured unless requested, or if a standard blood test shows an abnormality that requires a more in-depth analysis. These tests can provide a more complete picture of heart health, immunity, calcium absorption, blood sugar regulation, and a number of other vital processes.</p> <p>The chapters in each part cover the various labs included in the panel or test group. Along with reference ranges for the lab value, there is a &#x201c;target,&#x201d; or optimal range. While the optimal range may vary slightly for some individuals, this is the general range to which most people should strive.

In <i>The Sovereignty of Quiet</i>, Kevin Quashie explores quiet as a different kind of expressiveness, one which characterizes a person&#x2019;s desires, ambitions, hungers, vulnerabilities, and fears. Quiet is a metaphor for the inner life, and as such, enables a more nuanced understanding of black culture.<p>The book revisits such iconic moments as Tommie Smith and John Carlos&#x2019;s protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and Elizabeth Alexander&#x2019;s reading at the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. Quashie also examines such landmark texts as Gwendolyn Brooks&#x2019;s <i>Maud Martha</i>, James Baldwin&#x2019;s <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, and Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Sula</i> to move beyond the emphasis on resistance, and to suggest that concepts like surrender, dreaming, and waiting can remind us of the wealth of black humanity.</p></p><p><p>KEVIN QUASHIE is an associate professor of Afro-American studies at Smith College. He is the author of <i>Black Women, Identity, and Cultural Theory: (Un)Becoming the Subject</i> (Rutgers University Press).</p>"<i>The Sovereignty of Quiet</i> is a profound and excellent look at quiet and its relationship with black identity, black culture, and existentialism. With impeccable scholarship, beautiful writing, and powerful arguments, Quashie makes a fabulous contribution to the field. A&nbsp;success!" (Debra Walker King <i>author of African Americans and the Culture of Pain</i>)<br><br>"With fluid and beautiful prose, Quashie&#x2019;s book not only offers readers another way to think about African American selfhood, but also other ways to approach the very act of reading itself." (Emily Bernard <i>author of Carl Van Vechten and the Harlem Renaissance</i>)<br><br>"Quashie challenges the general assumption that African American commentary is expressed in loud voices as he studies the often-overlooked internal conflicts of 'black culture'. His intertwining of both factual and fictional situations provides a brilliant and intriguiging insight that ultimately suggests an overwhelming gentle message about African American protest and resistance.

Allston died in 2014.One Month Ago, Pyria System: Borleias Occupation, Day 1<br><br>&#x201c;A god cannot die,&#x201d; Charat Kraal said. &#x201c;Therefore it can have no fear of death. So who is braver, a god or a mortal?&#x201d;<br><br>Charat Kraal was a pilot of the Yuuzhan Vong&#x2014;humanoid, a little over two meters in height. His skin, where it was not covered by geometric tattoos, was pale, marked everywhere by the white, slightly reflective lines of old scars. Some years-ago mishap had eaten away the center of his face, eliminating even the diminutive nose common to the Yuuzhan Vong, leaving behind brown-crusted cartilage and horizontal holes into his sinus passages. His forehead angled back less dramatically than many of the Yuuzhan Vong and looked a trifle more like the forehead of a human, for which two warriors had taunted him, for which he had killed them. He disguised the trait as much as he could by yanking out the last of the hair on his head and adding skulltop tattoos that drew the eye up and back, away from the offending forehead. One day he would earn an implant that would further mask his deformity and end his problem.<br><br>He wore an ooglith cloaker, the transparent environment suit of Yuuzhan Vong pilots, over a simple warrior&#x2019;s loincloth. Both garments were living creatures, engineered and bred to perform only the tasks demanded of them, to aid the Yuuzhan Vong in their pursuit of glory.<br><br>He sat in the cockpit of his coralskipper, the irregular rocklike space fighter of his kind, but he did not wear his cognition hood at the moment; the masklike creature that kept him in mental contact with his craft, that allowed him to sense with its senses and pilot it with the agility of thought rather than muscle and reaction, was set to the side while his coralskipper cruised on routine patrol.<br><br>He and his mission partner, Penzak Kraal, were in distant orbit above the world Borleias. The planet had been recently seized from the infidels native to this galaxy so that it could be used as a staging area for the Yuuzhan Vong assault on the galactic throneworld of Coru- scant. Borleias was an agreeably green world, not overgrown with the dead, crusty dwellings of the infidels, not strewn with their unnatural implements of technology; only a military base, now smashed, had affronted the Yuuzhan Vong with evidence of infidel occupation.<br><br>The voice of Penzak Kraal emerged from the small, head-shaped villip mounted on the cockpit wall just beneath the canopy. Though most coralskippers were not equipped with villips, relying instead on the telepathic signals of yammosk war coordinators for all their communications, long-distance patrol craft did call for a means for direct communications. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot. If a god is the god of bravery, then by definition he must be braver than any Yuuzhan Vong, than anything living.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder. Let us say then that you could become immortal as the gods, and never die, but remain one of the Yuuzhan Vong. You would never face death. Could you then be as brave as the Yuuzhan Vong? You could kill forever but never truly risk death, defy death, choose your time and place of death. Which is better, to be brave for a lifetime or to kill forever?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who cares? The choice is not ours. But if I were to choose, I think I would choose immortality. Live long enough, and you might learn how to be brave as a Yuu- zhan Vong again. Kill long enough, and you could perhaps learn to kill a star.&#x201d;<br><br>Charat Kraal sobered. &#x201c;I have heard . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That the infidels did that. Learned to kill a star.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard Penzak Kraal hiss in irritation; in the villip he saw his partner&#x2019;s lopsided features go even more off center as his mouth pulled down in an expression of contempt. &#x201c;So what if they did? They killed it the wrong way, with their wrong minds and their wrong devices. And, like idiots, they must have lost the secret. Or they&#x2019;d be destroying the worldships one by one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have also heard . . .&#x201d; Charat Kraal lowered his voice, a foolish instinct, since no one but Penzak Kraal could be listening to him. &#x201c;That gods may smile upon them, too. On the infidels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ridiculous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you know the minds of the gods?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can no more know the minds of the gods than summon one of the enemy battleships to destroy for my personal glory.&#x201d;<br><br>In the distance, away from Borleias, many kilometers from them, an enemy battleship winked into existence, its bow pointed toward them. The ship was already up to speed; it grew rapidly as it neared them, as it approached Borleias.<br><br>&#x201c;Penzak, you fool.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My words did not summon it, you idiot.&#x201d; The villip&#x2019;s face blurred and adjusted, reflecting a change to Pen- zak&#x2019;s features; Penzak had pulled on his cognition hood. Charat did likewise. His surroundings, the cockpit interior, seemed to become transparent, giving him a view in all directions through the senses of the coralskipper, showing him in breathtaking detail the onrushing enemy ship.<br><br>No, now it was ships. More and more of the loathsome things of metal were dropping out of hyperspace, all aimed at Borleias. At Charat and Penzak.<br><br>A moment later, Charat could feel a buzz through the cognition hood, a telltale sign that Penzak was sending a warning to the Domain Kraal commander on Borleias.<br><br>The foremost New Republic ship, a sharply angled triangle in white, passed over the two coralskippers, blotting out the sun, casting them into shadow. Nowhere near so large as a Yuuzhan Vong worldship, it was still of impressive size, and so near that Charat felt he could reach out and drag his finger along its hull as it passed.<br><br>Penzak Kraal sent his coralskipper into a dive and turned to match the larger craft&#x2019;s course. Charat paced him. Above, he saw thruster gouts from the ship&#x2019;s belly herald the launching of the hated infidel starfighers.<br><br>&#x201c;How do we hurt them worst?&#x201d; Charat asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Follow me in,&#x201d; Penzak said. &#x201c;While they&#x2019;re launching. Don&#x2019;t engage the fighters; bait them so they follow us. The ship won&#x2019;t fire on us with the fighters in close proximity. We&#x2019;ll enter their launching bays and destroy the facilities there, then gut the ship from within.&#x201d; He looped around, rising and angling in toward the ship&#x2019;s belly. Charat followed.<br><br>Mon Mothma, one of the newest cruisers in the New Republic&#x2019;s fleet, a Star Destroyer refitted with gravity-well generators capable of interfering with the short jumps made by Yuuzhan Vong craft, cruised straight toward Borleias from the point where it had dropped out of hyperspace. This hadn&#x2019;t been a timed drop&#x2014;they&#x2019;d plotted a course straight for the planet Borleias, and the planet&#x2019;s gravity well had dragged them into realspace when they&#x2019;d come close enough. And now before them was the blue-green world they had come to recapure.<br><br>&#x201c;No sign of a Yuuzhan Vong worldship in orbit,&#x201d; reported the sensor officer, a Mon Calamari male with deep blue skin. &#x201c;The two coralskippers are turning to engage.&#x201d;<br><br>General Wedge Antilles, a lean man with a careworn face and military posture, commander of the fleet group for which Mon Mothma was the flagship, nodded. &#x201c;Gunnery, stay on them, vape them if they come against us. Fighter control, continue launching starfighter squadrons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Data screens lit up with colored blips as New Republic starfighters&#x2014;X-wings, A-9s, B-wings, E-wings, and more&#x2014;streamed out of the docking bays and turned toward the planet. Wedge, standing at the captain&#x2019;s station toward the rear of the spacious bridge, ignored the screens. He concentrated instead on the live view of Borleias, which filled the main viewport at the bow end of the bridge.<br><br>I hope the Vong here have come to love this world, he told himself. Because I&#x2019;m going to take it from them. They&#x2019;re going to learn what it is to lose the things they love.<br><br>Luke Skywalker hit his thrusters. His X-wing roared out of the main docking bay, losing altitude relative to the Mon Mothma. Behind him, eleven pilots of Twin Suns Squadron, the temporary X-wing squad that was his command, formed up on him. &#x201c;Twin Suns away,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Twin Suns, copy.&#x201d; That would be the controller on Mon Mothma&#x2019;s bridge. &#x201c;Be advised, two coralskippers are maneuvering into your flight path.&#x201d;<br><br>Luke glanced at his sensor board. Two red blips were indeed turning from below to head toward them. &#x201c;Squadron, follow me out, let&#x2019;s give these two the gauntlet treatment.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard a chorus of acknowledgments. There was tension in some of the voices, but not alarm. All his pi- lots were veterans, survivors of the Sabers, the Shocks, and other squadrons that had been reduced to shield trios, wing pairs, and solo pilots during the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Coruscant mere days earlier. Two of them, forming with him a shield trio, were his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker, and the Corellian-Security-officer-turned-pilot-turned-Jedi named Corran Horn. All his pilots were disciplined and competent. Many wanted revenge.<br><br>Luke understood how they felt. The Vong, aided by their human agent Viqi Shesh, had almost managed to kidnap his and Mara&#x2019;s infant son, Ben, just days ago. They had killed his nephew Anakin, and his nephew Jacen was missing. The losses, especially that of his apprentice Anakin, created an ache within him that he could not soothe.<br><br>In his youth, Luke would have been anxious for payback, but today he set that portion of himself aside. That was dark side thinking, immature thinking. It had been a long time since he had been a smooth-faced innocent; the scars of combat and lines of age had accumulated on his face, matching the weight of experience and calm that had accumulated on his spirit.<br><br>He extended his perceptions and sought Mara with them. He found her and almost flinched away from the contact; she was now an icy presence, concentrated totally on their mission.<br><br>He shrugged. Iciness was better than one alternative. Mara, despite her cool and controlled manner, was as anguished as he by the near loss of Ben and the loss of their nephews, and it would be no surprise to find her lit like a lightsaber with a desire for revenge. The fact that she wasn&#x2019;t meant that she was in control.<br><br>&#x201c;S-foils to attack position,&#x201d; Luke said, and suited action to words by flipping the switch that split the X-wings&#x2019; flight surfaces into their familiar X-shaped attack profile. &#x201c;First and third trios, take the leader, the rest on the wingmate. Fire at will.&#x201d; He linked his lasers to quad fire, so that all four would fire with a single press of the trigger, and opened up on the lead coralskipper. Four red streams of destructive laser energy lanced out against the coralskipper&#x2014;<br><br>No, it was eight streams. Luke&#x2019;s burst, aimed at the starboard side of the skip, never reached its target; a blackness appeared before it, distorting space around it like a gigantic magnifying lens, drawing the laserfire into it. Those four red lances of energy simply bent and dis- appeared. But Mara&#x2019;s burst, aimed at the port side, hit the coralskipper an instant after Luke&#x2019;s vanished. He grinned; she must have been using her own Force abilities to monitor him, as well. She couldn&#x2019;t have timed it so expertly otherwise. Her lasers raked across the enemy starfighter&#x2019;s hull until the distortion flicked over to interpose itself, then Luke fired again, chipping away at the coralskipper&#x2019;s stern. His blasts were joined by Corran&#x2019;s. The coral-like material of the skip&#x2019;s hull superheated and the lasers tore red-hot gouges along the surface.</p><h2>Kentucky Atlas &amp; Gazetteer (Delorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>Delorme, a travel planning resource.

It was given to me on Sunday last by Carrie Collier Fritch on the occasion of my marriage to Luke McCamie Spenser. Carrie says I am to use it to record my joys and sorrows, and to keep a thorough record of our wedding trip overland to Colorado Territory and the events in the life of an old married woman. Then I&#x2019;m to send it back to her. <br>Well, maybe I will, and maybe I won&#x2019;t. <br>I was married in my navy blue China silk with the mutton-leg sleeves, a sensible dress, because I am not given to extravagances. Besides, there was not time to make a proper wedding ensemble, since Luke was anxious to be married and on our way out west. As I did not care to begin my new life with a matrimonial squall, I dutifully agreed, although meekness is not in my nature. <br>This marriage happened so fast that it took away my breath. I had no idea Luke thought of himself as my beau. Everyone believed I was a confirmed old maid, destined to do no more in life than spend my afternoons tutoring refractory scholars in grammar and penmanship, as I have done for two years. At best, I might have wed Abner Edkins&#x2014;perhaps I should say &#x201c;at worst,&#x201d; because Abner never was my choice, and if the truth be told, I would rather be an old maid than his bride. Still, I have Abner to thank for my wedded bliss. Luke said Abner confided in him that he had plans to make a proposal of marriage to me before the week was out. So although Luke had supposed he would wait a while longer before declaring himself, my Darling Boy came to the farm ahead of Abner and made known his intentions. That was exactly four weeks to the day before our marriage. <br>I was swept off my feet, as the saying goes, for I had never expected to make such a handsome match. Luke is by far the best catch in Lee County. He spent two years away at normal school before leaving to defend the dear old Union. His is a noble character, and he was one of the first to join up from Iowa, proved his mettle at Shiloh, where he was felled by a bullet. He spent several weeks in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, then was discharged and sent home to recuperate on the family farm, where his parents hoped he would stay for good. Luke&#x2019;s father owns many sections of land, on which is situated a fine house. It is much larger and grander than our humble farm, although I think ours more cheerful. <br>But farming at Fort Madison is not for Luke. He tried it for a time, but when he was fully recovered from his wounds, he went away to claim a homestead in far-off Colorado. Then he returned to claim a wife. I&#x2019;ve known Luke all my life, but I never thought of him as my lover. I had believed him to be Persia Chalmers&#x2019;s suitor because they have been keeping company ever so long. So imagine my surprise when the wife he desired was Self! <br>Luke is of a good build and height, just over six feet, with hair like the stubble left in the fields after haying, and eyes as luminously blue as agates. When he smiles, the right side of his mouth curves up more than the left. He has a pleasant countenance, and his face is not so plain as mine. Unlike my life&#x2019;s partner, I am plain all over. My form is too thin, my face too square, and my forehead broad. Being somewhat over five feet eight inches in height, I am too tall ever to be considered a looker. Handsome is the best I might be, and then only on special occasions, and in poor light. <br>My plainness does not bother Luke. He says it is an asset, since we will be living in a Godless land, where men become crazed where women are concerned. I would not want to cause him vexation by attracting admiring glances, so it seems that neither one of us has to worry about me on that score. Well, it&#x2019;s the first time I ever was glad to be plain. <br>&#x201c;You are a suitable cook and well made for work, and you&#x2019;ll have plenty of that where we&#x2019;re going. You are a strong-minded woman and not given to foolish ways. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re not the kind to attract men like bees around the honey,&#x201d; he said when he proposed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bound for Colorado, and if you&#x2019;re agreeable, you may come, too. I&#x2019;m clean in my ways and a Christian, and I promise to be the best husband I know how. So if you&#x2019;ll agree, Mattie, I&#x2019;d be proud to take you as my wife. I require a yes or no right away.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t a pretty speech. Surprised and pleased though I was, I wished there had been a little less common sense, and more passion to his proposal. I suppose a prudent man (and Luke is that) should choose a wife with the same expert eye he turns on a cow. Still, I chided him a little before giving my answer. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say a word about love, Luke Spenser,&#x201d; said I. <br>He rebuked me, and rightly so. &#x201c;I thought you to be a practical girl. If it&#x2019;s words you want, you ought to wait for Abner. He&#x2019;ll be along directly,&#x201d; replied he. Then he blushed and added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not much for that kind of talk, but do you think I would be here if I did not have feelings for you?&#x201d; <br>Well, having studied mathematics to discipline the mind during the two years I spent at Oberlin College, I think I am a practical girl&#x2014;practical enough to know Luke might find another if I did not reply at once. And perhaps it was best he spoke his mind in such a direct way, giving me a clear view of our future together instead of sugarcoating it with silly speeches. I believe Carrie is right in saying that strong men are not given to declarations of love, anyway. <br>So I meditated on it for a few moments. Marriage is life&#x2019;s most serious step for a woman, and the proposal, catching me unaware as it had, seemed to call for contemplation. Still, at that instant, I knew he had won my heart and should have my hand, as well. I replied promptly, in the manner of his proposal, &#x201c;You suit me, Luke, and so does your proposal.&#x201d; <br>What does not suit me so well is this business of the matrimonial bed. I&#x2019;ve never seen a man stark before, and it was an odd thing, though not so much of a surprise. (He has six toes on each foot, which I have not mentioned to him, as Luke does not care to be teased. Nor did I laugh at his skinny legs when first I saw them sticking out from under his nightshirt.) But it was the act itself that disappointed. Carrie had told me not to expect too much, but still, I had hoped for more. There must be a reason the cows crowd the bull, and the sows the boar. I wonder what a pig knows that I don&#x2019;t. <br>The first night, Luke did not touch me at all, which I blamed on the excitement of the day and his respect for my feelings, since I was not only ignorant of what would happen in bed but also frightened. <br>The second night, he thrashed about, hurting me a little. Then it was over. I&#x2019;d judge it took a minute, no more than two, at most. So it is not a serious loss of time. Carrie promised I&#x2019;d get used to it and even grow to like it, but I doubt that. I shall be happy to dispense with it when we have as many children as we want. I thought there would be kissing and hugging, but except for a peck on the cheek at our wedding, which embarrassed me so much that I wiped it off, Luke does not seem inclined to show such affection. <br>I precede myself. The wedding was in the dear little Methodist-Episcopal church where I grew up and until a week ago taught Sunday school. It was decorated with white lilacs and white candles. Luke gave me a ring of gold with a cluster of garnets set in it. <br>I asked Carrie to attend me so that there would be no cause for jealousy among my sisters from my choosing one above the others. Besides, Carrie is exactly my age and has ever been my dearest friend, and I wanted her beside me as I took the first step into my new life. Luke chose Abner to stand up with him, but Abner pouted so during the service that he almost spoiled the day. I was bound he should not do so, for it was my day. So I told Abner I thought Persia was sweet on him. That cheered him somewhat, although I know he would rather have me than her. Just think of it! Two men prefer me to Persia Chalmers! <br>Afterward, Father said, &#x201c;How do, Mrs. Spenser,&#x201d; and I turned to Luke&#x2019;s mother, which made everyone laugh, except for Mama Spenser, who frowned. It is a good thing we are to leave for Colorado soon, or I would have my work cut out for me on her account. <br>My own dear mother outdid herself with the tasty repast following the service. And my beloved Carrie made splendid bride and groom cakes. She hugged me as soon as the deed &#x2019;twas done and said now we were both old married women. O, I am sad at the thought of leaving her, but &#x201c;a woman is supposed to cleave to her husband,&#x201d; I told her. That was when Carrie whispered not to expect too much in bed for a while. <br>The night prior to our wedding, Luke gave me a little trunk made of black leather, lined in blue-and-white ticking, with a cunning compartment hidden in the lid. I like it fine, and I will use it to store my favorite things, including this journal. <br>In, turn, I presented Luke with a yellow silk vest that I had fashioned myself and embroidered all over with flowers. I had stayed awake late into the night to make it, and I was rewarded when Luke wore it at our ceremony. He seemed quite pleased when Persia admired it. I fancied she was jealous of me for snatching Luke away, because the saucy girl told me she&#x2019;d never seen a bride in such an ugly dress. <br>&#x201c;Why, Persia, what would make you say such a thing?&#x201d; I asked, more from surprise than annoyance. <br>&#x201c;Why would I say such a thing?&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Because it is true.&#x201d; <br>So I returned the &#x201c;favor,&#x201d; and when no one was watching, I stuck out my tongue at Persia. Cry shame! Marriage has made me bold. May 17, 1865. Overland Trail, Missouri. Fifty-four miles west from Fort Madison. <br>We are off! Four days on the trail! <br>We had planned to leave the third day after our wedding, but dear, thoughtful Husband said he would give me more time for my good-byes, for who knows when we will ever see our loved ones again? Nonetheless, I was anxious to be away, since I did not want people looking at me in the way they do at all brides. It was bad enough staying with Mother and Father Spenser and knowing they were watching. And listening! <br>I thanked Luke for his consideration and did not let on that I knew the real reason for not leaving as scheduled was that he was not satisfied with the provisions. Then there was that business about the pigs. Luke had bought a sow from a farmer for us to take along, but she swolled up and did not look as if she could make the trip. I was just as glad to be rid of her, because I don&#x2019;t fancy driving a pig to Colorado. Maybe Luke changed his mind, for he asked for the return of his money instead of a second pig. I&#x2019;ve learned this much about Luke: He demands satisfaction in all things, and that makes me wonder why he chose me for his life&#x2019;s companion, as I am far from perfect. I pray he does not regret our marriage, as I will not. I should be quite out of sorts if he tried to return me like the pig, so I shall be careful not to swoll up. <br>After we agreed to be engaged, we spent every waking moment in preparation for the trip to Colorado. I gave much time to the cooking and drying and salting of food. There were quilts to be finished&#x2014;I hope Luke knows his haste is responsible for my failing to have the thirteen handmade coverlets required of brides&#x2014;and, Lordy, what a lot of packing and unpacking, then packing all over again. Luke, who is the cleverest of men, told me to store my prized Delft plate and other breakables in the barrels of flour, cornmeal, and sugar. <br>Husband warned me I could take only the most practical items. We had many a merry discussion of what fit his term of &#x201c;practical,&#x201d; and as he insists I am to be an obedient wife, he got his way. At least he thinks so. Oh, I am learning a great deal about men! I have taken my little japanned writing desk, which fits snugly on my lap, for I place the highest value on letters to and from home (as well as recording events in this journal). And hidden among the pots and pans are these little items I consider indispensable, though Husband may not: the pillow cover Carrie made from cigar silks, the hair wreath from Aunt Sabra, and, of course, my velvet bonnet with the cunning flowers. Bonnets are my especial weakness. I brought along a sunbonnet, too, but it is an ugly, hateful thing. I wore it all last summer in the fields, but now that I am Mrs. Luke Spenser, I&#x2019;ve grown vain and hope that I shall never have to wear it again. <br>I insisted on taking my little walnut commode, which was Grandmother McCauley&#x2019;s and is filled with my clothing and our bedding. It is the repository, as well, for my Holy Bible and Dr. Chase&#x2019;s Recipes, or Information for Everybody, for which I gave a dollar. Sister Mary tucked in scraps of rose madder-dyed goods for a quilt and pillow slips trimmed in lace. She and the other girls at home worry that I will not have pretty things in Colorado Territory, but I say I don&#x2019;t need them. The way Luke describes our new homestead, I think it will be prettier than anything I could take with me. <br>This little book comes, too, hidden in the secret compartment of the trunk. Luke has not seen my journal yet, and I do not propose to show it to him, since I could not confide in it if I knew Luke were to read my words&#x2014;although I do not think he could do so easily, since when I finish writing across a page, I turn it so that I can write crosswise over the entry. I do not like keeping secrets from my &#x201c;guardian and master,&#x201d; but I fancy he may have one or two from me. We have so much to learn about each other. Of course, this means I may write only during moments when Luke is not around. Just now, he is off discussing oxen with the men. <br>There are not so many prairie ships headed for St. Joseph as earlier in the season, since it is very late in the year for emigrants to embark. Besides, some travelers take the stage and are then outfitted on the Missouri. Luke felt we could do better with our money by buying some of our farm implements at home and avoiding as much as possible the gougers at St. Joe. It is not the most direct route, says Husband, but we can get the best provisioning there. The wagons we see are pulled by oxen, but we are transported by six grays, which Luke&#x2019;s father gave us as a wedding present. They are as handsome a team of horses as there ever was, but more suited to carriages than to a Conestoga. I confided such to Luke, for I know as much about a farm as any man, but he said he hadn&#x2019;t solicited my opinion. He has asked everybody else&#x2019;s opinion, however, about whether to swap the horses for mules or oxen when we get to St. Joe. I shall try to do as Carrie warned me, keeping my mouth shut and managing Luke in other ways. <br>We had been married nearly a week before we pulled out. Though we were early astir, Mother, Father, and my three sisters and two brothers were there to see us off. They slept only a few hours before rising for chores and hurrying to the Spensers&#x2019; place, where Luke and I were nearly ready to embark on our adventure. I miss the folks dreadfully already, especially the girls, as we were always a merry group&#x2014;and Carrie, too. She begged me not to forget her, and she said if we did not meet again in this life, we would surely be together in the next. Luke frowned when I pointed to the ground, meaning Hell, but Carrie and I broke into fits of the giggles. <br>As we started off, my youngest sister, Jemima, who is six, ran after the wagon, crying for her &#x201c;sugar.&#x201d; Luke stopped, but I could see he was vexed at doing it. So I let her love my neck and gave her the briefest of kisses. She had to content herself with waving us out of sight and shouting, &#x201c;Ho for Colorado!&#x201d; <br>Luke did not scold her, however.

Thus everyone agreed, without modification, that Joan Flanders was beautiful in the absolute&#x2014;fully beautiful, extremely beautiful, totally beautiful, but never &#x201c;still&#x201d; beautiful. Botox? Possibly. Other work? Only Joan and her doctors knew. The best in dental work, an aggressive workout regimen, the most gifted cosmeticians and hairdressers available to the select? That much certainly was true. </p><p>But even without the high-end maintenance, she would have been beautiful, with pale smooth skin, a lioness&#x2019;s mane of thick reddish blond hair, piercing blue eyes set behind prominent cheekbones, a slender stalk of neck and a mere slip of body, unfettered by excess ounces, much less pounds. She was dressed in tweeds and white cashmere, expertly tailored, and wore immense sunglasses that looked as if flying saucers of prescription glass had landed on the planet of her face. She took tea with a great deal of grace and wit, with her Hollywood agent, a famous name but with a dull generic quality to him no one would recognize, and her gay personal assistant. The group sat on the patio of the Lemon Tree in downtown East Hampton, New York, on a bright fall day with just a brush of chill in the air as well as salt tang from the nearby Atlantic. There were two other stars on the patio, of the young, overmoussed generation, one female, one indeterminate, as well as a couple of agents with their best-selling writers, the wives of a couple of Fortune 500 CEOs, and least three mistresses of other Fortune 500 CEOs, as well as the odd tourist couple and discreet celeb watchers, enjoying an unusually rich harvest of faces. </p><p>Joan and Phil were discussing&#x2014;the market recovery? Paramount&#x2019;s new vice president of production? The lousy scripts that were being sent her after the failure of her comeback picture <i>Sally Tells All</i>? Ex-hubby Tom&#x2019;s strange new obsession with the kiddie shoot-&#x2019;em-ups of his past? It doesn&#x2019;t matter. What matters is only that Joan was twice royalty: her father, Jack, had been one of the major stars bridging the pre- and postwar era and she had gotten his piercing eyes and bed-knob cheekbones. She was pure Hollywood blueblood, second generation. But as well, her second husband had been a prominent antiwar leader in the raging if far-off sixties, and her picture, aboard the gunner&#x2019;s chair on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft battery, had made her instantly beloved and loathed by equal portions of her generation. That made her political royalty, a part of the hallowed crusade to end a futile war; or it made her a commie bitch traitor, but still royalty. The rest was detail, albeit interesting. She had won an Oscar. She had been married to the billionaire mogul T. T. Constable, in one of the most documented relationships in history. She had made one of her several fortunes as an exercise guru and still worked out three hours a day and was as fit as any thirty-five-year-old. All who saw her that day felt her charisma, her history, her beauty, her royal presence, including the tourists, the other stars, the wives and mistresses, and her executioner. </p><p>He spared her and America the disturbing phenomenon of a head shot. Instead, he fired from about 340 yards out and sent a 168-grain Sierra hollow point boat tail MatchKing on a slight downward angle at 2,300 feet per second to pierce her between her fourth and fifth ribs on the left-hand side, just outside the armpit; the missile flew unerringly through viscera without the slightest deviation and had only lost a few dozen pounds of energy when it hit her in the absolute center of the heart, exactly where all four chambers came together in a nexus of muscle. That organ was pulped in a fraction of a second. Death was instantaneous, a kind of mercy, one supposes, as Ms. Flanders quite literally could not have noticed her own extinction. </p><p>As in all cases of public violence, a moment of disbelief occurred when she toppled forward, accidentally broke her fall on the table for a second, but then torqued to the right and her body lost purchase and completed its journey with a graceless thud to the brick of the patio. Nearly everyone thought &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fainted,&#x201d; because the rifle report was so far away and suppressed that no identifier with the information &#x201c;gun&#x201d; was associated with the star&#x2019;s fall to earth. It took a second more for the exit wound to begin copious blood outflow, and that product spread in a dark sheen from her body, at which point the human fear of blood&#x2014;quite natural, after all&#x2014;asserted itself and screams and panic and running around and jumping up and down and diving for cover commenced. </p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t long before the police arrived and set up crime scene operations, and not long at all after that when the first of what would become more than three hundred reporters and photographers arrived on scene and the whole two blocks of downtown East Hampton took on an aspect that resembled none of Joan Flanders&#x2019;s twenty-eight films but vividly recalled those made by an Italian gentleman named Federico Fellini. In all that, no one noticed a blue Ford van pulling out of an alley 340 yards away to begin a trip to another destination and another date with history. </p><p>The shooter did not spare his audience the theatrics of gore for his next two victims. He went for the head, hit it perfectly, and blew each one all over the insides of the Volvo in which they were just beginning their daily commute. The range this time was shorter, 230 yards, but the ordnance was identical and the accuracy just as superb. He hit the first target one inch below the crown of the skull, dead center. There had been no deviation through the rear window glass of the heavy Swedish car. Unlike in the Flanders hit, there was no immediate hubbub. Jack Strong merely slumped forward until his shattered skull hit the steering wheel and rested. His wife, Mitzi Reilly, pivoted her head at the ruckus, had a second&#x2019;s worth of abject horror&#x2014;police found urine in her panties, a fact not publicized, thankfully&#x2014;before the second bullet hit her above and a little forward of the left ear. In both cases the hollow point target bullet blossomed in its puncture of skull bone and spun sideways, whimsically, as it plowed through brain matter, then exited in a horrendous gusher of blood, gray stuff, and bone frags, above an eye in one case, below the other eye in the other, cracking the face bone like a pie plate. </p><p>The car, which was in gear and running, then eased forward under the pressure of Jack&#x2019;s dead foot and hit the wall of the garage, where its progress halted. No one heard the gunshots, and indeed, the sound of gunshots in that part of Chicago was not remarkable to begin with. Jack and Mitzi lay like that for over an hour until a FedEx truck came down the alley seeking a shortcut through Hyde Park. The driver had trouble getting by, noticed the exhaust tendrils still curling from the pipe, and got out to inquire of the drivers what was going on. He discovered the carnage, called 911, and within minutes the Fellini movie starring Chicago police, FBI, and media had commenced on this site too. </p><p>It would be said that Jack and Mitzi went out together as they had lived, fought, and loved together. They were famous, not as much as Joan Flanders, but in their own world stars as well. Both tracked their pedigrees back to the decade of madness against which Joan Flanders had stood out. But it had been so long ago. </p><p>Jack, high-born (n� Golden) of Jewish factory owners, well educated, passionate, handsome, had grown up in the radical tradition in Hyde Park, taken his act to Harvard, then Columbia, had been a founder of Students for Social Reform, and for a good six years was the face of the movement. At a certain point he despaired of peaceful demonstration as a means of affecting policy, much less lowering body count, and in 1971 went underground, with guns and bombs. </p><p>It was there that he met the already famous Mitzi Reilly, working-class Boston Irish, fiery of temperament and demeanor, intellectually brilliant, who had already been photographed on the sites of several bombings and two bank robberies. Redheaded with green eyes and pale, freckly skin, she was the fey Irish lass turned radical underground guerrilla woman-warrior, beloved by media and loathed by blue-collar Americans. She reveled in her status, and when Jack came aboard&#x2014;it was a matter of minutes before they were in the sack together, and the fireworks there were legendary!&#x2014;the team really took off, both in fame and in importance. They quickly became the number one most wanted desperadoes on J. Edgar&#x2019;s famous list, and somehow, through sympathetic journalists, continued to give interviews, stand still for pictures&#x2014;both had great hair, thick, luxuriant, and strong, artistic faces; they burned holes in film&#x2014;and operate. </p><p>Their biggest hit was the bombing of the Pentagon. Actually, it was a three-pound bag of black powder going boom off a primitive clock fuse in a waste can that created more smoke than damage, but it was symbolic, worth more than a thousand bombs detonated at lesser targets. It closed down a concourse for a couple of hours, more because of the insane press coverage than for any actual threat to people or operations, but it made them stars of an even bigger magnitude. </p><p>Their career began to turn when they were building a bigger bomb for a bigger target, but this time the boom came in the bedroom, not the Capitol, and both fled, leaving behind a good sister who&#x2019;d managed to blow herself up. They were hunted and running low on money, and a violent bank robbery may or may not have followed&#x2014;the FBI said yes, it was them; the Nyackett, Massachusetts, police were split&#x2014;that left two security guar...</p></p><h2>The Old Curiosity Shop (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The story of Little Nell and her "tragedy of sorrows," told in a blend of realism and fairy-tale</b><br><br>The sensational bestselling story of Little Nell, the beautiful child thrown into a shadowy, terrifying world, seems to belong less to the history of the Victorian novel than to folklore, fairy tale, or myth. The sorrows of Nell and her grandfather are offset by Dickens's creation of a dazzling contemporary world inhabited by some of his most brilliantly drawn characters-the eloquent ne'er-do-well Dick Swiveller; the hungry maid known as the "Marchioness"; the mannish lawyer Sally Brass; Quilp's brow-beaten mother-in-law; and Quilp himself, the lustful, vengeful dwarf, whose demonic energy makes a vivid counterpoint to Nell's purity.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The sound of Little Nell clattering hurriedly over cobblestones immediately sets the stage by bringing to mind the narrow and dangerous streets of Victorian London. No fewer than 20 performers are called upon to conjure up the Dickensian world of wanderers, ne'er-do-wells, con artists, and kind Samaritans--and each performance is excellent. Tom Courtenay plays the sadistic Quilp, "the ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny" with magnificent sarcastic glee, and Teresa Gallagher's silvery, childlike voice is ideally suited for the role of the angelic Little Nell. <p> Nell is on her way home to the dusty shop where she and her grandfather live a rather mysterious life. The old man disappears every night--visiting gambling dens with the naive hope of winning a fortune. Instead he sinks deeper and deeper into debt. Enter Daniel Quilp, moneylender, who becomes furious upon learning that the grandfather is a pauper and will never be able to repay his tremendous debt. Quilp seizes the curiosity shop and begins making lecherous overtures to Nell, so she and her grandfather steal away one morning to seek their fortunes elsewhere. But the demonic dwarf is never far behind.</p> <p> Sound effects are employed judiciously and serve mainly as a springboard for the listener's imagination. The sound of a crying baby is enough to convey the image of crowded lodgings and genteel Victorian poverty, while raucous laughter and high-pitched squawks evoke the barely controlled chaos of an outdoor Punch and Judy show. The dramatization pares Dickens's weighty novel down to two and one-half hours, but does so skillfully, retaining Dickens's wit, marvelous dialogue, and delightful characterizations.

Part autobiography, part social history, they document the career and interests of a senator and leading imperial official whose friends include the historians Tacitus and Suetonius. Pliny's letters cover a wide range of topics, from the contemporary political scene to domestic affairs, the educational system, the rituals and conduct of Roman religion, the treatment of slaves, and the phenomena of nature. He describes in vivid detail the eruption of Vesuvius, which killed his uncle, and the daily routines of a well-to-do Roman in the courts and at leisure, in the city, or enjoying rural pursuits at his country estates.<br> This is a lively new translation by eminent scholar Peter Walsh, based on the Oxford Classical Text and drawing on the latest scholarship. In his introduction, Walsh considers the political background of the letters, the span of Pliny's career, the range of topics covered in the letters, and Pliny's literary style. Invaluable notes identify the letters' recipients and explain allusions to historical events and terms. A general index is supplemented by two specific indexes on aspects of social life and Pliny's correspondents. This classic will make great reading for those with an interest in classical literature and ancient history.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Educating Our Children for the Common Good</h2><p><p>How can schools teach the skills required for a strong democracy to flourish? <em> What Kind of Citizen? </em>asks readers to imagine the kind of society they would like to live in&#x2015;and then shows the ways in which schools can be used to make that vision a reality. Westheimer draws on groundbreaking research on school programs and policies to sharply critique the current direction of school reform. He points to the many varied and powerful ways to teach children and young adults to engage critically, to think about social issues, and to participate in authentic debate that acknowledges that intelligent adults can have different opinions. But today&#x2019;s teachers are being forced to abandon these practices in favor of test-preparation in only a very narrow set of academic subjects. How did this happen? What can we do to set schools back on the right track? How can we realign school goals with what research shows parents, children, and teachers actually care about? How can we save our schools from today&#x2019;s myopic interpretation of what constitutes an education? Westheimer answers these questions and makes a powerful call for schools to become more engaging, more democratic, and more educative.</p> <p><strong>Book Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li> A comprehensive look at why schools should be at the forefront of public engagement and how educators and policymakers can make that happen.</li> <li> Accessible and engaging discussions based on consultations with hundreds of school teachers and civic leaders. </li> <li> Empirical research from one of the most influential frameworks for citizenship and democratic education, &#x201c;Three Kinds of Citizens,&#x201d; that emerged from collaboration between the author and Dr. Joseph Kahne.</li></ul></p><p><p><br> "Among the many casualties of a preoccupation with rigor and accountability is the prospect of education for meaningful democratic citizenship. In this refreshingly accessible book, Westheimer not only makes that point but explains the importance of helping students to think critically and question tradition. He issues a welcome invitation to connect our conception of the ideal school to its impact on our broader society."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Alfie Kohn</strong><br> , author of<br> <em>Feel-Bad Education</em><br> and<br> <em>The Myth of the Spoiled Child</em><br> </p><br><br><p><br> "What does it mean to be a democratic citizen? And what kind of education produces one? For the past 2 decades, Joel Westheimer has been one of North America's most knowledgeable and able guides to these critical issues. Along the way, he has forced us to reconsider the larger goals and purposes of our public schools. His book will provide an invaluable roadmap for anyone who asks the big questions, no matter what they think of his answers."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Jonathan Zimmerman</strong><br> , Professor of Education and History, New York University<br> </p><br><br><p><br> "In this highly readable, persuasive book, Joel Westheimer reminds us that, in our zeal for higher test scores, we seem to have forgotten the highest aim of education&#x2014;to produce better people, more thoughtful citizens."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Nel Noddings</strong><br> , Lee Jacks Professor of Education Emerita, Stanford University<br> </p><br><br><p><br> "Joel Westheimer has for many years challenged teachers, students, and community members with a profound series of questions: Who are we?

Joel Westheimer, who has spent years studying and investigating civic engagement of students, has written this brilliant book to make the case for civic and critical engagement of our students, rather than a standardized curriculum. The book is compelling, very accessible, full of inspiring examples, and sometimes even funny. It's a book that every teacher should have and that would make any mother proud."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Andy Hargreaves</strong><br> , Thomas More Brennan Chair in Education, Boston College<br> </p><br><br><p><br> "Joel Westheimer argues persuasively that the current emphasis on standardization in the schools not only diminishes teacher professionalism, but conflicts with citizenship education. Students these days learn to answer questions, but<br> <em>citizens</em><br> learn to ask them. The methods now imposed by federal and state mandates might apply with equal force in authoritarian societies.

Not only does he dismantle the pedagogy of testing, instrumental rationality, and repression at work in the public schools, he reclaims and extends the important goal of defining schools as democratic public spheres, students as engaged citizens, and social responsibility as central to the project of education."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Henry Giroux</strong><br> , Global Television Network Chair in Communication Studies, McMaster Univeristy<br> </p><br><br><p><br> "This astute, incisive, and informative book makes it explicit with rich theoretical ideas and empirical data that schools&#x2014;whether consciously or not&#x2014;teach citizenship knowledge, skills, and values. Westheimer argues compellingly that educators should make the pivotal decision about what kind of citizens they aim to develop. His rigorous conceptual analyses and powerful examples of citizenship education courses, programs, and experiences provide practicing educators with a goldmine of information and examples that can help them to construct experiences that will prepare thoughtful, active, and engaged citizens.

He was surprised to find that yoga classes at home were missing the humor, joy, and celebration that fueled his Eastern studies. Instead of expanding and enhancing the joy of being, Western yoga classes focused obsessively on correcting body positions and developing a picture-perfect physique. Determined to keep his yoga practice true to cultivating bliss and inner radiance, Ross started his own yoga studio and has created a yoga movement in Los Angeles that is, to put it simply, revolutionary.</p><p>Ross lives and teaches according to his belief that the secret to yoga is not obsessing over whether your feet are parallel or whether you can bend as far as the person on your left can, but about transcending the serious and allowing joy into your life, your body, your mind, and hopefully your yoga practice itself. It's about lightening up.</p><p>In <em>Happy Yoga</em>, Ross reveals that everyone is inherently happy, but that our true self is shadowed and concealed by the layers of worry that, through habit, become our daily thoughts. In each chapter, he examines one of our seven greatest human fears -- depression, ill health, loss of love, career failure, war, death, and emotional stasis -- and uses yoga wisdom to explain how to strip away these worries to reach your core of calm radiant joy. By sharing his system of yoga postures, diet, meditation, music, supplements, and philosophy, Ross has effected profound physical and mental changes in both his life and the lives of his students.</p><p>Ross's power is that he goes back to the source -- five thousand years of ancient yogic wisdom -- and decodes the abstract Eastern ideas for a Western audience. Happy Yoga is not just a set of movements and facts to consume, it is a way of shifting your awareness to bring the spirit of yoga into each movement, each meal, each relationship, each thought, and each breath.</p><p>With love and joyful abandon, Ross offers us a new way to practice and live yoga. The result is profound calm, a dramatic release of anxiety and pain, and the realization that there really is nothing to worry about.</p></p><p><p>Steve Ross has been a yoga instructor for twenty years. Called Yogi to the Stars by <em>InStyle</em>, Ross has appeared in numerous publications including <em>Vanity Fair</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. He is the host of <em>Inhale</em>, an early morning yoga program on the Oxygen network, and is a yoga teacher and retreat leader at Maha Yoga in his hometown of Los Angeles.</p>Much more than a guide to the physical practice of yoga, this book-like yoga itself-is about life, and about how to exist happily with oneself and the external world. It's based on the premise that if one gets rid of wanting and worldly desire, one can achieve "uninterrupted happiness and a constant experience of joyful wonder." Ross, a yogi to the stars, believes that fulfillment can and should come from within, and he offers generally sound advice for how to move towards a state of happiness, discover true love and be always blissful. All this could easily come across as hokey, but many of Ross's points are surprisingly resonant and logical (if not always simple to follow). In the quest for love, for example, he reminds readers, "If you've ever been around someone who wants your approval badly and wants your love badly, you may have noticed that the more the person pursues you-or stalks you, as the case may be-the more turned off you become." Quotes from yogis, comedians and ancient proverbs reinforce many of his arguments, and each chapter includes photographs and explanations of yoga poses to support the chapter's lessons. Excessive use of exclamation points, an underlying L.A.-inspired assumption that most of the world thinks being rich and famous will bring inner peace and some over-the-top health and medical advice are distracting, but getting past these flaws will allow readers to access many nuggets of wisdom and sage guidance. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This "Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to Awareness" provides helpful guideposts along an experiential journey for those Western minds predisposed to wandering off to old habits, cherished presumptions, and a stubbornly solid sense of self. With ease and clarity Ralston teaches readers how to become aware of the background patterns that they are usually too busy, stressed, or distracted to notice. <i>The Book of Not Knowing</i> points out the ways people get stuck in their lives and offers readers a way to make fresh choices about every aspect of their lives, from a place of awareness instead of autopilot.</p></p><p><p>In 1975, Peter Ralston founded Cheng Hsin, a dogma-free approach to using direct experience in body/mind training, and two years later opened The Cheng Hsin School of Internal Martial Arts and Center for Ontological Research in Oakland, California. The first non-Asian ever to win the World Championship full-contact martial arts tournament, Ralston is author of <i>Zen Body-Being, Cheng</i> <i>Hsin: Principles of Effortless Power, </i>and other books.</p>&#x201c;True innovators are, by definition, ahead of their time. Therefore, they remain largely unrecognized, except by a few. How many of us wish we had met Bruce Lee, sat in a session with Carl Jung, or walked around Walden Pond with Thoreau?

Jos� Ra�l Capablanca (1888&#x2013;1942) had no need for isolated artistic theory or compositions &#x2014; he composed and created chess art as he played. All of his genius &#x2014; intuitive, tactical, strategic, logical &#x2014; all of his art shines clearest in his endings, as he himself was proud to declare, advising others to study them carefully. "In order to improve your game," he said, "you must study the endgame before anything else; for whereas the endings can be studied and mastered by themselves, the middle game and the opening must be studied in relation to the endgame."<br>The best way to follow Capablanca's advice is through this &#x2014; the only book devoted to his great endings, 60 complete games emphasizing the grand <i>finale</i> but annotated throughout.<br>Irving Chernev communicates in his notes the mystery and wonder as well as the delight in discovering again and again the original, fertile mind of chess's greatest born player. "Virtuoso," "exquisite," "profound," "inspired," "elegant," and "fiendish ingenuity" describe match and tournament games and endings against Alekhine, Steiner, Marshall, Nimzowitsch, Lasker, R�ti, and others, the best in the contemporary chess world. Capablanca's eleventh game in the 1901 Cuban championship (which he won, aged 12) "surpasses any accomplishment by such other prodigies as Morphy, Reshevsky, and Fischer." From age 12 through the last game in the book (nearly four decades later against Reshevsky at Nottingham, 1936), Capablanca fashions endgames in tense tournament atmosphere that seem like delicate, precise instruments dreamt at leisure.<br>Here then is the essence of Capablanca, analyzed for the instruction of players and the pleasure of chess connoisseurs. Included are indexes of openings, themes in the endings, and opponents, as well as a bibliography and record of tournament and match play. Capablanca: for players, the epitome of the endgame; for readers, a classic chess study.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>And Grandma Said... Iroquois Teachings: as passed down through the oral tradition</h2><p><i>The Iroquois culture and traditional Longhouse spirituality has a universal appeal, a ring of truth to it that resonates not only with other indigenous people, but also with non-Native people searching for their own spiritual roots.</i> <br><br> Raised in the home of a grandmother who spoke only Mohawk, Sakokweni�nkwas (Tom Porter) was asked from a young age, to translate for his elders. After such intensive exposure to his grandparents' generation, he is able to recall in vivid detail, the stories and ceremonies of a culture hovering on the brink of extinction. After devoting most of his adult life to revitalizing the culture and language of his people, Tom finally records here, the teachings of a generation of elders who have been gone for more than twenty years. <br><br> Beginning with an introduction about why he is only now beginning to write all this down, he works his way chronologically through the major events embedded in Iroquois oral history and ceremony, from the story of creation, to the beginnings of the clan system, to the four most sacred rituals, to the beginnings of democracy, brought to his people by the prophet and statesman his people refer to as the Peacemaker. Interspersed with these teachings, Tom tells us in sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic detail, the effect of colonization on his commitment to those teachings. <br><br> Like a braid, the book weaves back and forth between these major teachings, and briefer teachings on topics such as pregnancy, child-rearing and Indian tobacco, weaving the political with the spiritual. Through his recollections of "Grandma," and what she said, we also get an inside view of the life of a Mohawk man, and his struggles. Sometimes articulate and at other times inventive with his second language of English, Tom takes us on the journey with him, asking us to trade eyes, by "erasing the blackboard" to see if we "can understand what a Mohawk sees, feels, is ha</p><p></p><h2>Speak Up!: An Illustrated Guide to Public Speaking</h2><p>Written by professors with 40+ combined years&#x2019; experience teaching the course and a competitive background in debate, <em>Speak Up!</em> connects with students through lively writing, compelling real-life examples, practical guidance, and hundreds of custom-drawn illustrations that bring public speaking concepts to life.

A beloved icon who found success as an actress, a mother, and a humanitarian, Audrey Hepburn perfected the art of gracious living.<br><br>More philosophy than biography, <i>How to Be Lovely</i> revisits the many interviews Audrey gave over the years, allowing us to hear her voice directly on universal topics of concern to women the world over: careers, love lives, motherhood and relationships. Enhanced by rarely seen photographs, behind-the-scenes stories, and insights from the friends who knew her well, <i>How to Be Lovely</i> uncovers the real Audrey, in her own words.</p><p>An avid Audrey Hepburn fan, <b>Melissa Hellstern</b> is a freelance writer living in Chicago. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>How to Be Lovely: The Audrey Hepburn Guide to Life&nbsp;</i>and <i>Getting Along Famously:&nbsp;A Celebration of Friendship</i>.Introduction <br><br> When it comes to elegance and style, few women surpass Audrey Hepburn. She has become an adjective-�so Audrey�-describing some ethereal combination of grace, elegance, charm, and wisdom.<p> While her clothing style remains a grounding influence on fashion, it is her character that is certain to withstand the test of time. Audrey taught us that being a woman is as simple as knowing who you are, and who you are not. </p><p> And somehow we suspected that if anyone would have the right answers, it would be her: �Amazing the questions they will ask characters like us . . . the questions-all the way from what do I think of love or how does it feel to be a star, to enormous ones, even political, with as many prongs as a pitchfork. Here I am, an innocent little actress trying to do a job, and it seems that my opinion on policy in the Middle East is worth something. I don�t say I don�t have an opinion, but I doubt it�s worth.� </p><p> To the world, she represented all that a woman could be, and we wanted in. We still do. By looking at her words from interviews over the years, we may just find a new revelation or two, and certainly some we knew all along. </p><p> May the light she shared with the world shine on in the lives of those of us she continues to inspire. <br><br> one<br> Happiness <br><br> �The most important thing is to enjoy your life-to be happy-that�s all that matters.� <br></p><p> A happy life has been pursued in every culture, in every country, in every generation. But after all this time, there are still no rules for how to get it. And the more you try to pin it down, the more elusive it seems. </p><p> By now, we surely know that money can�t buy it. There are those who have very little and are very happy. And others who seem to have it all, but are not. Still, we all look for the next reason to be happy. What if it is not about what happens to us, what we own or where we live, but how we look at it? </p><p> Maybe those rose-colored glasses aren�t such a bad idea after all. <br><br> Attitude Is Everything<br> Once upon a time, Audrey Hepburn was a just a girl. </p><p> A girl who took ballet and dreamed of becoming the next Anna Pavlova. Who climbed trees with her brothers. Who read books in her room. Who often felt unsure in the world, but learned to get along. A girl who loved to be loved, just like the rest of us. </p><p> As she grew, there were the usual hardships we all find somewhere along the way. Disappointment. Frustration. Struggle. A dwindling bank balance. And some most of us can hardly fathom-overnight success, fame, miscarriages, studio execs, while the whole world watched. </p><p> Regardless of what life threw her way, Audrey was a person who sparkled. She never failed to remember what we too often forget-that life itself is a glorious opportunity. <br><br> �Pick the day. Enjoy it-to the hilt. The day as it comes. People as they come. . . . The past, I think, has helped me appreciate the present-and I don�t want to spoil any of it by fretting about the future.� </p><p> �Not to live for the day, that would be materialistic-but to treasure the day. I realize that most of us live on the skin-on the surface-without appreciating just how wonderful it is simply to be alive at all.� </p><p> �My own life has been much more than a fairy tale. I�ve had my share of difficult moments, but whatever difficulties I�ve gone through, I�ve always gotten a prize at the end.� </p><p> �If my world were to cave in tomorrow, I would look back on all the pleasures, excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadnesses, not my miscarriages or my father leaving home, but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough.� </p><p> �But what is happiness except the simple harmony between man and the life he lives?� <br> -Albert Camus <br><br> Listen to Your Mother Audrey�s mother, born Baroness Ella van Heemstra, grew up �wanting more than anything else to be English, slim, and an actress,� but her aristocratic heritage prevented such foolishness. Marriage and motherhood were on her agenda. The Baroness, as she preferred to be called, did marry. She also divorced because, as her friend so aptly put it, �she preferred that to taking a lover, like most.� Divorce was hardly commonplace, yet she stood tall as the single mother of two boys, Alexander and Ian. </p><p> Just a year later, she married Joseph Hepburn-Ruston. Together, they brought Audrey into the world. But it would be up to her mother to help her navigate through it. <br><br> �Being the daughter of a baroness doesn�t make you any different, except that my mother was born in 1900 and had had herself a very strict, Victorian upbringing, if you like. So, she was very demanding of us-of me and my brothers. �Manners,� as she would say, �don�t forget, are kindnesses. You must always be kind.� Opening the door for old ladies is just a routine so that you know she�s helped. And she was always very adamant about that.� </p><p> �My mother taught me to stand straight, sit erect, use discipline with wine and sweets and to smoke only six cigarettes a day.� </p><p> �I was given an outlook on life by my mother. . . . It was frowned upon not to think of others first. It was frowned upon not to be disciplined.� </p><p> �It�s that wonderful old-fashioned idea that others come first and you come second. This was the whole ethic by which I was brought up. Others matter more than you do, so don�t fuss, dear; get on with it.� </p><p> �As a child, I was taught that it was bad manners to bring attention to yourself, and to never, ever make a spectacle of yourself. . . . </p><p> All of which I�ve earned a living doing.� <br><br> �I can really take no credit for any talent that Audrey may have. If it�s real talent, it�s God-given. I might as well be proud of a blue sky, or the paintings in the Flemish exhibition at the Royal Academy.� <br><br> -her mother, Baroness Ella van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston <br><br> Keep It All in Perspective<br> Ten-year-old Audrey was just feeling settled at her boarding school outside London when her mother packed up the family and moved to Arnhem, Holland. World War II was coming and only among her own neutral Dutch would her mother, now a single parent, feel safe. �Famous last words,� Audrey would later say. </p><p> Just days after Audrey�s eleventh birthday, the Germans stormed into town. In the years that followed, food and liberty became scarce and treachery lurked everywhere. Audrey would lose friends, uncles, and nearly both brothers. </p><p> When liberation did come-on Audrey�s sixteenth birthday-the family had escaped with their lives, but the memories would last a lifetime. <br><br> �Don�t discount anything awful you hear or read about the Nazis. It�s worse than you could ever imagine.� </p><p> �We lost everything, of course-our houses, our possessions, our money. But we didn�t give a hoot. We got through with our lives, which was all that mattered.� </p><p> �At times like this, you learn about death, privation, danger, which makes you appreciate safety and how quickly it can change. You learn to be serious about what counts.� </p><p> �Being without food, fearful for one�s life, the bombings-all made me appreciative of safety, of liberty. In that sense, the bad experiences have become a positive in my life.� </p><p> �It made me resilient and terribly appreciative for everything good that came afterward. I felt enormous respect for food, freedom, for good health and family- for human life.� <br><br> Expect Less<br> By the age of sixteen, Audrey knew much more than most. She had already seen the worst mankind had to offer. </p><p> Audrey noticed that during the war people were kind and generous. But once the liberation came, not everyone had learned the lesson. How easily we are able to forget what really matters when it comes down to it. </p><p> Audrey always knew just what she wanted in life: safety, food, and family. The rest was just icing on the cake. <br><br> �Being an actress just happened; I had no intention of it.�<br> �I�ve had so much more than I ever dreamed possible out of life-[no] great disappointments or hopes that didn�t work out . . . <br> I�ve accomplished far more than I ever hoped to, and most of the time it happened without my seeking it.� <br><br> Be Perfectly Human<br> Most of us never really knew Audrey. We knew Princess Anne, Holly Golightly, and Eliza Doolittle. In some ways, we made her into the ideal we all wanted her to be-perfect. An image that can be hard to live up to. </p><p> Audrey was one of us. She was as real as the girl next door, only smarter. <br><br> �Truly, I�ve never been concerned with any public image. It would drive me around the bend if I worried about the pedestal others have put me on. And also I don�t believe it.� </p><p> �People seem to have this fixed image of me. In a way I think it�s very sweet, but it�s also a little sad. After all, I�m a human being. When I get angry, I sometimes swear.� <br><br> CHARADE<br> �Cary and I had never met before we did Charade, so there we all were in Paris, about to have dinner at some terribly smart bistro. As it was early spring, Cary, who always dressed impeccably, was wearing an exquisite light-tan suit. I know I was thrilled to meet him, and I must have been terribly excited, because not ten seconds after we started chatting I made some gesture with my hand and managed to knock an entire bottle of red wine all over poor Cary and his beautiful suit. He remained cool. I, on the other hand, was horrified. Here we�d only just been introduced! If I somehow could have managed to crawl under the table and escape without ever having to see him again, I happily would have.� <br><br> Live Without Regret<br> For years, Audrey tried to balance her need for family with the world�s need to watch her onscreen, until one day she finally left movie-making behind altogether. </p><p> It was during the filming of Wait Until Dark, for which she would earn her fifth Oscar nomination, that it hit her. The long separation from her son Sean, now seven years old and in school, was just too much. She had to make a change. And change she did. In just under two years, she divorced, remarried, and gave birth to her second son, Luca. She also left Hollywood for home, not to be seen again on the big screen for close to ten years. It was the best decision she ever made. <br><br> �It would be terribly sad, wouldn�t it, to look back on your life in films and not know your children? For me there�s nothing more pleasant or exciting or lovely or rewarding than seeing my children grow up . . . and they only grow up once, remember.� </p><p> �You can only hope to get a combination of happy work and a happy life.� </p><p> �One thing I would have dreaded would be to look back on my life and only have movies.� </p><p> �I never expected to be a star, never counted in it, never even wanted it. Not that I didn�t enjoy it all when it happened. (But) it�s not as if I were a great actress. I�m not Bergman. I don�t regret for a minute making the decision to quit movies for my children.� </p><p> �I may not always be offered work, but I�ll always have my family.� </p><p>" <br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Semicolon: The Past, Present, and Future of a Misunderstood Mark</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Delightful.&#x201d; &#x2014;</strong><strong>Mary Norris, </strong><em><strong>The New Yorker</strong></em></p><p><strong>A page-turning, existential romp through the life and times of the world&#x2019;s most polarizing punctuation mark</strong><br><br>The semicolon.

Now, Truss and Timmons put hyphens, parentheses, quotation marks, periods, and more in the spotlight, with silly scenes showing how which marks you choose and where you put them can cause hilarious mix-ups.</p><p>Lynne Truss is a writer and journalist who started out as a literary editor with a blue pencil and then got sidetracked. The author of three novels and numerous radio comedy dramas, she spent six years as the television critic of <i>The Times of London</i>, followed by four (rather peculiar) years as a sports columnist for the same newspaper. She won Columnist of the Year for her work for Women&#x2019;s Journal. Lynne Truss also hosted Cutting a Dash, a popular BBC Radio 4 series about punctuation. She now reviews books for the Sunday Times of London and is a familiar voice on BBC Radio 4. She lives in Brighton, England.<br>BONNIE TIMMONS is best known for inspiring and creating images for the television show <i>Caroline in the City</i> and illustrating numerous national ad campaigns.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;This follow-up to <i>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</i> (about the importance of commas) (2006) and <i>The Girl's Like Spaghetti</i> (about apostrophes) (2007, both Putnam) emphasizes the importance of punctuation in general. Truss again makes the case that careless application can dramatically change one's meaning. To prove her point, she provides contrasting examples of the same sentence, punctuated in different ways. Timmons's charming watercolors make the change in meaning clearer. In one example, a child gazes at a tower of presents obscuring a Christmas tree, and Truss writes, "'Do you know who came last night? Santa Claus,' said my mom." On the facing page, Santa addresses his elves-"'Do you know who came last night?' Santa Claus said. 'My mom.'" (Needless to say, no pile of presents accompanies the arrival of Santa's mom.) In each example, the pertinent punctuation marks are printed in red. An afterword provides additional explanation for each pair of examples. The references to royalty and Christian tradition point to the book's British origin, but Truss's examples should still be clear to North American students. <i>Twenty-Odd Ducks</i> will be most effective through guided reading in small groups, though savvy children may enjoy it as an amusing pleasure read.&#x2014;<i>Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Mind of God,</i> physicist Paul Davies explores whether modern science can provide the key that will unlock this last secret. In his quest for an ultimate explanation, Davies reexamines the great questions that have preoccupied humankind for millennia, and in the process explores, among other topics, the origin and evolution of the cosmos, the nature of life and consciousness, and the claim that our universe is a kind of gigantic computer. Charting the ways in which the theories of such scientists as Newton, Einstein, and more recently Stephen Hawking and Richard Feynman have altered our conception of the physical universe. Davies puts these scientists' discoveries into context with the writings of philosophers such as Plato. Descartes, Hume, and Kant. His startling conclusion is that the universe is "no minor byproduct of mindless, purposeless forces. We are truly meant to be here." By the means of science, we can truly see into the mind of God.</p><p><b>PAUL DAVIES</b> is Director of the Beyond Center at Arizona State University and the bestselling author of more than twenty books.

Many beliefs are no doubt innate: we are born with them as a result of evolutionary factors. Some beliefs we feel we can justify, others we hold because of "gut feelings."<br><br>Obviously many of our beliefs are wrong, either because they are incoherent, or because they conflict with other beliefs, or with the facts. Two and a half thousand years ago, in ancient Greece, the first systematic attempt was made to establish some sort of common grounds for belief. The Greek philosophers sought a means to formalize human reasoning by providing unassailable rules of logical deduction. By adhering to agreed procedures of rational argument, these philosophers hoped to remove the muddle, misunderstanding, and dispute that so characterize human affairs. The ultimate goal of this scheme was to arrive at a set of assumptions, or axioms, which all reasonable men and women would accept, and from which the resolution of all conflicts would flow.<br><br>It has to be said that this goal has never been attained, even if it were possible. The modern world is plagued by a greater diversity of beliefs than ever, many of them eccentric or even dangerous, and rational argument is regarded by a lot of ordinary people as pointless sophistry. Only in science, and especially mathematics, have the ideals of the Greek philosophers been upheld (and in philosophy itself, of course). When it comes to addressing the really deep issues of existence, such as the origin and meaning of the universe, the place of human beings in the world, and the structure and organization of nature, there is a strong temptation to retreat into unreasoned belief. Even scientists are not immune from this. Yet there is a long and respectable history of attempts to confront such issues by rational and dispassionate analysis. Just how far can reasoned argument take us? Can we really hope to answer the ultimate questions of existence through science and rational inquiry, or will we always encounter impenetrable mystery at some stage? And just what is human rationality anyway?<br><br><i>The Scientific Miracle</i><br><br>Throughout the ages all cultures have extolled the beauty, majesty, and ingenuity of the physical universe. It is only the modern scientific culture, however, that has made any systematic attempt to study the nature of the universe and our place within it. The success of the scientific method at unlocking the secrets of nature is so dazzling it can blind us to the greatest scientific miracle of all: <i>science works.</i> Scientists themselves normally take it for granted that we live in a rational, ordered cosmos subject to precise laws that can be uncovered by human reasoning. Yet why this should be so remains a tantalizing mystery. Why should human beings have the ability to discover and understand the principles on which the universe runs?<br><br>In recent years more and more scientists and philosophers have begun to study this puzzle. Is our success in explaining the world using science and mathematics just a lucky fluke, or is it inevitable that biological organisms that have emerged from the cosmic order should reflect that order in their cognitive capabilities? Is the spectacular progress of our science just an incidental quirk of history, or does it point to a deep and meaningful resonance between the human mind and the underlying organization of the natural world?<br><br>pardFour hundred years ago science came into conflict with religion because it seemed to threaten Mankind's cozy place within a purpose-built cosmos designed by God. The revolution begun by Copernicus and finished by Darwin had the effect of marginalizing, even trivializing, human beings. People were no longer cast at the center of the great scheme, but were relegated to an incidental and seemingly pointless role in an indifferent cosmic drama, like unscripted extras that have accidentally stumbled onto a vast movie set. This existentialist ethos -- that there is no significance in human life beyond what humans themselves invest in it -- has become the leitmotif of science. It is for this reason that ordinary people see science as threatening and debasing: it has alienated them from the universe in which they live.<br><br>In the chapters that follow I shall present a completely different view of science. Far from exposing human beings as incidental products of blind physical forces, science suggests that the existence of conscious organisms is a <i>fundamental</i> feature of the universe. We have been written into the laws of nature in a deep and, I believe, meaningful way. Nor do I regard science as an alienating activity. Far from it. Science is a noble and enriching quest that helps us to make sense of the world in an objective and methodical manner. It does not deny a meaning behind existence. On the contrary. As I have stressed, the fact that science Works, and works so well, points to something profoundly significant about the organization of the cosmos. Any attempt to understand the nature of reality and the place of human beings in the universe must proceed from a sound scientific base. Science is not, of course, the only scheme of thought to command our attention. Religion flourishes even in our so-called scientific age. But as Einstein once remarked, religion without science is lame.<br><br>The scientific quest is a journey into the unknown. Each advance brings new and unexpected discoveries, and challenges our minds with unusual and sometimes difficult concepts. But through it all runs the familiar thread of rationality and order. We shall see that this cosmic order is underpinned by definite mathematical laws that interweave each other to form a subtle and harmonious unity. The laws are possessed of an elegant simplicity, and have often commended themselves to scientists on grounds of beauty alone. Yet these same simple laws permit matter and energy to self-organize into an enormous variety of complex states, including those that have the quality of consciousness, and can in turn reflect upon the very cosmic order that has produced them.<br><br>Among the more ambitious goals of such reflection is the possibility that we might be able to formulate a "Theory of Everything" -- a complete description of the world in terms of a closed system of logical truths. The search for such a TOE has become something of a holy grail for physicists. And the idea is undoubtedly beguiling. After all, if the universe is a manifestation of rational order, then we might be able to deduce the nature of the world from "pure thought" alone, without the need for observation or experiment. Most scientists reject this philosophy utterly, of course, hailing the empirical route to knowledge as the only dependable path. But as we shall see, the demands of rationality and logic certainly do impose at least some restrictions on the sort of world that we can know. On the other hand, that same logical structure contains within itself its own paradoxical limitations that ensure we can never grasp the totality of existence from deduction alone.<br><br>History has thrown up many physical images for the underlying rational order of the world: the universe as a manifestation of perfect geometrical forms, as a living organism, as a vast clockwork mechanism, and, most recently, as a gigantic computer. All of these images capture some key aspect of reality, though each is incomplete on its own. We shall examine some of the latest thinking about these metaphors, and the nature of the mathematics that describes them. This will lead us to confront the questions: What is mathematics? And why does it work so well in describing the laws of nature? And where do these laws come from anyway? In many cases the ideas are easy to describe; sometimes they are rather technical and abstract. The reader is invited to share this scientific excursion into the unknown, in search of the ultimate basis of reality. Though the going gets rough here and there, and the destination remains shrouded in mystery, I hope that the journey itself will prove exhilarating.<br><br><i>Human Reason and Common Sense</i><br><br>It is often said that the factor which most distinguishes human beings from other animals is our power to reason. Many other animals seem to be aware of the physical world to a greater or lesser extent, and to respond to it, but humans claim more than mere awareness. We also possess some sort of <i>understanding</i> of the world, and of our place within it. We are capable of predicting events and of manipulating natural processes to our own ends, and although we are part of the natural world, we somehow distinguish between ourselves and the rest of the physical universe.<br><br>In primitive cultures, understanding of the world was limited to everyday affairs, such as the passage of the seasons, or the motion of a slingshot or an arrow. It was entirely pragmatic, and had no theoretical basis, except in magical terms. Today, in the age of science, our understanding has,vastly expanded, so that we need to divide knowledge up into distinct subjects -- astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, psychology, and so on. This dramatic progress has come about almost entirely as a result of "the scientific method": experiment, observation, deduction, hypothesis, falsification. The details need not concern us here. What is important is that science demands rigorous standards of procedure and discussion that set reason over irrational belief.<br><br>The concept of human reasoning is itself a curious one. We are persuaded by "reasonable" arguments, and feel happiest with those that appeal to "common sense." Yet the processes of human thought are not God-given. They have their origin in the structure of the human brain, and the tasks it has evolved to perform. The operation of the brain, in turn, depends on the laws of physics and the nature of the physical world we inhabit. What we call common sense is the product of thought patterns deeply embedded in the human psyche, presumably because they confer certain advantages in dealing with everyday situations, like avoiding falling objects and hiding from predators. Some aspects of human thought will be fixed by the wiring of our brains, others inherited as "genetic software" from our ancestors of long ago.<br><br>The philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that not all our categories of thought derive from sensory experience of the world. He believed that some concepts are <i>a priori,</i> by which he meant that, although these concepts are not <i>necessary truths</i> in the strictly logical sense, nevertheless all thought would be impossible without them: they would be "necessary for thought." One example Kant gave was our intuitive understanding of three-dimensional space through the rules of Euclidean geometry. He supposed that we are born with this knowledge. Unfortunately, scientists have now discovered that Euclidean geometry is actually wrong! Today, scientists and philosophers generally suppose that even the most basic aspects of human thought must ultimately refer back to observations of the physical world. Probably the concepts that are most deeply etched in our psyche, the things that we find it hard to imagine could be otherwise -- such as "common sense" and human rationality -- are those that are genetically programmed at a very deep level in our brains.<br><br>It is interesting to speculate whether alien beings who evolved under very different circumstances would share our concept of common sense, or indeed any of our thought patterns. If, as some science-fiction writers have mused, life existed on the surface of a neutron star, one could not begin to guess how such beings would perceive and think about the world. It is possible that an alien's concept of rationality would differ from ours so greatly that this being would not be at all persuaded by what we would regard as a rational argument.<br><br>Does this mean that human reasoning is suspect? Are we being excessively chauvinistic or parochial in supposing that we can successfully apply the thought patterns of <i>Homo sapiens</i> to the great issues of existence? Not necessarily. Our mental processes have evolved as they have precisely because they reflect something of the nature of the physical world we inhabit. What is a surprise is that human reasoning is so successful in framing an understanding of those parts of the world our perceptions can't directly reach. It may be no surprise that human minds can deduce the laws of falling objects, because the brain has evolved to devise strategies for dodging them. But do we have any right to expect extensions of such reasoning to work when it comes to nuclear physics, or astrophysics, for example? The fact that it does work, and works "unreasonably" well, is one of the great mysteries of the universe that I shall be investigating in this book.<br><br>But now another issue presents itself. If human reasoning reflects something of the structure of the physical world, would it be true to say that the world is a manifestation of reason? We use the word "rational" to mean "in conformity with reason," so my question is whether, or to what extent, the world is rational. Science is founded on the hope that the world is rational in all its observable aspects. It is possible that there may be some facets of reality which lie beyond the power of human reasoning. This doesn't mean that these facets are necessarily irrational in the absolute sense. Denizens of neutron stars (or supercomputers) might understand things that we, by the very nature of our brains, cannot. So we have to be aware of the possibility that there may be some things with explanations that we could never grasp, and maybe others with no explanation at all.<br><br>In this book I shall take the optimistic view that human reasoning is generally reliable. It is a fact of life that people hold beliefs, especially in the field of religion, which might be regarded as irrational. That they are held irrationally doesn't mean they are wrong. Perhaps there is a route to knowledge (such as through mysticism or revelation) that bypasses or transcends human reason? As a scientist I would rather try to take human reasoning as far as it will go. In exploring the frontiers of reason and rationality we will certainly encounter mystery and uncertainty, and in all probability at some stage reasoning will fail us and have to be replaced either by irrational belief or frank agnosticism.<br><br>If the world is rational, at least in large measure, what is the origin of that rationality? It cannot arise solely in our own minds, because our minds merely reflect what is already there. Should we seek explanation in a rational Designer? Or can rationality "create itself" by the sheer force of its own "reasonableness"? Alternatively, could it be that on some "larger scale" the world is irrational, but that we find ourselves inhabiting an oasis of apparent rationality, because that is the only "place" where conscious, reasoning beings could find themselves? To explore these sorts of questions further, let us take a more careful look at the different types of reasoning.<br><br><i>Thoughts About Thought</i><br><br>Two sorts of reasoning serve us well, and it is important to keep a clear distinction between them. The first is called "deduction." This is based on the strict rules of logic. According to standard logic, certain statements, such as "A dog is a dog" and "Everything either is, or is not, a dog," are accepted as true, while others, like "A dog is not a dog," are deemed false. A deductive argument starts out with a set of assumptions called "premises." These are ...</p><h2>Assaulted Caramel (An Amish Candy Shop Mystery)</h2><p><i>Sometimes you need a sweet tooth to take a bite out of crime . . .</i><br><br>Bailey King is living the sweet life as assistant chocolatier at world-famous JP Chocolates in New York City.

Gorman takes the apostle seriously, as someone who speaks for God and to us. After an overview not only of Paul&#39;s radical transformation from persecutor to proclaimer but also of his letter-writing in the context of Paul&#39;s new mission, Reading Paul explores the central themes of the apostle&#39;s gospel: Gorman places special emphasis on the theopolitical character of Paul&#39;s gospel and on the themes of cross and resurrection, multiculturalism in the church, and peacemaking and nonviolence as the way of Christ according to Paul. Gorman also offers a distinctive interpretation of justification by faith as participation in Christ-an interpretation that challenges standard approaches to these Pauline themes. Reading Paul demonstrates that the apostle of faith, hope, and love speaks not only to our deepest spiritual needs but also to the challenging times in which we live.</p><p>Michael J.

Something, somewhere in all those stars, had touched her.<br><br>She thought: Jacen!<br><br>Her husband's hands touched controls and the stars streamed away, turned to bleeding smears of light as if seen through beaten rain, and the distant touch vanished.<br><br>"Jacen," she said, and then, at her husband's startled look, at the surprise and pain in his brown eyes, "Jacen."<br><br>"And you're sure?" Han Solo said. "You're sure it was Jacen?"<br><br>"Yes. Reaching out to me. I felt him. It could have been no one else."<br><br>"And he's alive."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Leia Organa Solo could read him so well. She knew that Han believed their son dead, but that he tried, for her sake, to pretend otherwise. She knew that, fierce with grief and with guilt for having withdrawn from his family, he would support her in anything now, even if he believed it was delusional. And she knew the strength it took for him to suppress his own pain and doubt.<br><br>She could read all that in him, in the flicker of his eye, the twitch of his cheek. She could read him, read the bravery and the uncertainty, and she loved him for both.<br><br>"It was Jacen," she said. She put as much confidence in her tone as she could, all her assurance. "He was reaching out to me through the Force. I felt him. He wanted to tell me he was alive and with friends." She reached over and took his hand. "There's no doubt, now. Not at all."<br><br>Han's fingers tightened on hers, and she sensed the struggle in him, desire for hope warring with his own bitter experience.<br><br>His brown eyes softened. "Yes," he said. "Of course. I believe you."<br><br>There was a hint of reserve there, of caution, but that was reflex, the result of a long and uncertain life that had taught him to believe nothing until he'd seen it with his own eyes.<br><br>Leia reached for him, embraced him awkwardly from the copilot's seat. His arms went around her. She felt the bristle of his cheek against hers, inhaled the scent of his body, his hair.<br><br>A bubble of happiness grew in her, burst into speech. "Yes, Han," she said. "Our son is alive. And so are we. Be joyful. Be at peace. Everything changes from now on."<br><br>*** The idyll lasted until Han and Leia walked hand in hand into the Millennium Falcon's main hold. Through the touch, Leia felt the slight tension of Han's muscles as he came in sight of their guest--an Imperial commander in immaculate dress grays.<br><br>Han, Leia knew, had hoped that this mission would provide a chance for the two of them to be alone. Through the many months since the war with the Yuuzhan Vong had begun, they had either been apart or dealing with a bewildering succession of crises. Even though their current mission was no less urgent than the others, they would have treasured this time alone in hyperspace.<br><br>They had even left Leia's Noghri bodyguards behind. Neither of them had wanted any passengers at all, let alone an Imperial officer. Thus far Han had managed to be civil about it, but only just.<br><br>The commander rose politely to her feet. "An exceptionally smooth transition into hyperspace, General Solo," she said. "For a ship with such--such heterogeneous components, such a transition speaks well of the ship's captain and his skills."<br><br>"Thanks," Han said.<br><br>"The Myomar shields are superb, are they not?" she said. "One of our finer designs."<br><br>The problem with Commander Vana Dorja, Leia thought, was that she was simply too observant. She was a woman of about thirty, the daughter of the captain of a Star Destroyer, with bobbed dark hair tucked neatly into her uniform cap, and the bland, pleasant face of a professional diplomat. She had been on Coruscant during its fall, allegedly negotiating some kind of commercial treaty, purchasing Ulban<br>droid brains for use in Imperial hydroponics farms. The negotiations were complicated by the fact that the droid brains in question could equally well be used for military purposes.<br><br>The negotiations regarding the brains' end-use certificates had gone nowhere in particular, but perhaps they had been intended to go nowhere. What Commander Dorja's extended stay on Coruscant had done was to make her a close observer in the Yuuzhan Vong assault that had resulted in the planet's fall.<br><br>Vana Dorja had gotten off Coruscant somehow--Leia had no doubt that her escape had been planned long in advance--and she had then turned up at Mon Calamari, the new provisional capital, blandly asking for help in returning to Imperial space just at the moment at which Leia had been assigned a diplomatic mission to that selfsame Empire.<br><br>Of course it wasn't a coincidence. Dorja was clearly a spy operating under commercial cover. But what could Leia do? The New Republic might need the help of the Empire, and the Empire might be offended if its commercial representative were needlessly delayed in her return.<br><br>What Leia could do was establish some ground rules concerning where on the Falcon Commander Dorja could go, and where was strictly off limits. Dorja had agreed immediately to the restrictions, and agreed as well to be scanned for any technological or other secrets she might be smuggling out.<br><br>Nothing had turned up on the scan. Of course. If Vana Dorja was carrying any vital secrets to her masters in the Empire, she was carrying them locked in her all-too-inquisitive brain.<br><br>"Please sit down," Leia said.<br><br>"Your Highness is kind," Dorja said, and lowered her stocky body into a chair. Leia sat across the table from her, and observed the half-empty glass of juri juice set before the commander.<br><br>"Threepio is providing sufficient refreshment?" Leia asked.<br><br>"Yes. He is very efficient, though a trifle talkative."<br><br>Talkative? Leia thought. What's Threepio been telling the woman?<br><br>Blast it anyway. Dorja was all too skilled at creating these unsettling moments.<br><br>"Shall we dine?" Leia asked. Dorja nodded, bland as always. "As Your Highness wishes." But then she proved useful in the galley, assisting Han and Leia as they transferred to plates the meal that had been cooking in the Falcon's automatic ovens. As Han sat down with his plates, C-3PO contemplated the table.<br><br>"Sir," he said. "A Princess and former Chief of State takes precedence, of course, over both a general and an Imperial commander. But a commander--forgive me--does not take precedence over a New Republic general, even one on the inactive list. General Solo, if you would be so kind as to sit above Commander Dorja?"<br><br>Han gave C-3PO a baleful look. "I like it fine where I am," he said. Which was, of course, as far away from the Imperial commander as the small table permitted.<br><br>C-3PO looked as distressed as it was possible for a droid with an immobile face to look. "But sir--the rules of precedence--" "I like it where I am," Han said, more firmly.<br><br>"But sir--"<br><br>Leia slid into her accustomed role as Han's interpreter to the world. "We'll dine informally, Threepio," she told the droid.<br><br>C-3PO's tone allowed his disappointment to show. "Very well, Your Highness," he said.<br><br>Poor 3PO, Leia thought. Here he was designed for working out rules of protocol for state banquets involving dozens of species and hundreds of governments, interpreting and smoothing disputes, and instead she persisted in getting him into situations where he kept getting shot at. And now the galaxy was being invaded by beings who had marked for extermination every droid in existence--and they were<br>winning. Whatever C-3PO had for nerves must be shot.<br><br>Lots of formal dinner parties when this is over, Leia decided. Nice, soothing dinner parties, without assassins, quarrels, or light-saber fights.<br><br>"I thank you again for your offer of transit to the Empire," Dorja said later, after the soup course. "It was fortunate that you have business there."<br><br>"Very fortunate," Leia agreed.<br><br>"Your mission to the Empire must be critical," Dorja probed, "to take you from the government at such a crucial time."<br><br>"I'm doing what I do best."<br><br>"But you were Chief of State--surely you must be considering a return to power."<br><br>Leia shook her head. "I served my term."<br><br>"To voluntarily relinquish power--I confess I don't understand it." Dorja shook her head. "In the Empire, we are taught not to decline responsibility once it is given<br>to us."<br><br>Leia sensed Han's head lifting as he prepared to speak. She knew him well enough to anticipate the sense of any remarks. No, he would say, Imperial leaders generally stay in their seats of power until they're blasted out by laser cannons. Before Han could speak, she phrased a more diplomatic answer.<br><br>"Wisdom is knowing when you've given all you can," she said, and turned her attention to her dinner, a fragrant breast of hibbas with a sauce of bofa fruit. Dorja picked up her fork, held it over her plate. "But surely--with the government in chaos, and driven into exile--a strong hand is needed."<br><br>"We have constitutional means for choosing a new leader," Leia reassured. And thought, Not that they're working so far, with Pwoe proclaiming himself Chief of State with the Senate deadlocked on Mon Calamari.<br><br>"I wish you a smooth transition," Commander Dorja said. "Let's hope the hesitation and chaos with which the New Republic has met its current crisis was the fault of Borsk Fey'lya's government, and not symptomatic of the New Republic as a whole."<br><br>"I'll drink to that," Han proclaimed, and drained his glass.<br><br>"I can't help but wonder how the old Empire would have handled the crisis," Dorja continued. "I hope you will forgive my partisan attitude, but it seems to me that the Emperor would have mobilized his entire armament at the first threat, and dealt with the Yuuzhan Vong in an efficient and expeditious manner, through the use of overwhelming force. Certainly better than Borsk Fey'lya's policy--if I understood it correctly as a policy--of negotiating with the invaders at the same time as he was fighting them, sending signals of weakness to a ruthless enemy who used negotiation only as a cover for further conquests."<br><br>It was growing very hard, Leia thought, to maintain the diplomatic smile on her face. "The Emperor," she said, "was always alert to any threat to his power."<br><br>Leia sensed Han about to speak, and this time was too late to stop his words.<br><br>"That's not what the Empire would have done, Commander," Han said. "What the Empire would have done was build a super-colossal Yuuzhan Vong-killing battle machine. They would have called it the Nova Colossus or the Galaxy Destructor or the Nostril of Palpatine or something equally grandiose. They would have spent billions of credits, employed thousands of contractors and subcontractors, and<br>equipped it with the latest in death-dealing technology. And you know what would have happened? It wouldn't have worked. They'd forget to bolt down a metal plate over an access hatch leading to the main reactors, or some other mistake, and a hotshot enemy pilot would drop a bomb down there and blow the whole thing up. Now that's what the Empire would have done."<br><br>Leia, striving to contain her laughter, detected what might have been amusement in Vana Dorja's brown eyes.<br><br>"Perhaps you're right," Dorja conceded.<br><br>"You're right I'm right, Commander," Han said, and poured himself another glass of water.<br><br>His brief triumph was interrupted by a sudden shriek from the Falcon's hyperdrive units. The ship shuddered. Proximity alarms wailed.<br><br>Leia, her heart beating in synchrony to the blaring alarms, stared into Han's startled brown eyes. Han turned to Commander Dorja.<br><br>"Sorry to interrupt dinner just as it was getting interesting," he said, "but I'm afraid we've got to blow some bad guys into small pieces."<br>The first thing Han Solo did when he scrambled into the pilot's seat was to shut off the blaring alarms that were rattling his brain around inside his skull. Then he looked out the cockpit windows. The stars, he saw, had returned to their normal configuration--the Millennium Falcon had been yanked out of hyperspace. And Han had a good idea why, an idea that a glance at the sensor displays served only to<br>confirm. He turned to Leia as she scrambled into the copilot's chair.<br><br>"Either a black hole has materialized in this sector, or we've hit a Yuuzhan Vong mine." A dovin basal to be precise, an organic gravitic-anomaly generator that the Yuuzhan Vong used for both propelling their vessels and warping space around them.<br>The Yuuzhan Vong had been seeding dovin basal mines along New Republic trade routes in order to drag unsuspecting transports out of hyperspace and into an ambush. But their mining efforts hadn't extended this far along the Hydian Way, at least not until now.<br><br>And there, Han saw in the displays, were the ambushers. Two flights of six coralskippers each, one positioned on either side of the dovin basal in order to intercept any unsuspecting transport.<br><br>He reached for the controls, then hesitated, wondering if Leia should pilot while he ran for the turbolaser turret. No, he thought, he knew the Millennium Falcon, her capabilities, and her crotchets better than anyone, and good piloting was going to get them out of this trouble more than good shooting.<br><br>"I'd better fly this one," he said. "You take one of the quad lasers." Regretting, as he spoke, that he wouldn't get to blow things up, something always good for taking his mind off his troubles.<br><br>Leia bent to give him a quick kiss on the cheek. "Good luck, Slick," she whispered, then squeezed his shoulder and slid silently out of the cockpit.<br><br>"Good luck yourself," Han said. "And find out if our guest is qualified to take the other turret."<br><br>His eyes were already scanning the displays as he automatically donned the comlink headset that would allow him to communicate with Leia on the turbolasers. Coralskippers weren't hyperspace capable, so some larger craft had to have dropped them here. Was that ship still around, or had it moved on to lay another mine somewhere else?<br><br>It had gone, apparently. There was no sign of it on the displays.<br><br>The Yuuzhan Vong craft were just now beginning to react to his arrival--so much for the hope that the Millennium Falcon's stealth capabilities would have kept her from being detected.<br><br>But what, he considered, had the enemy seen? A Corellian Engineering YT-1300 freighter, similar to hundreds of other small freighters they must have encountered. The Yuuzhan Vong wouldn't have seen the Falcon's armament, her advanced shields, or the modifications to her sublight drives that could give even the swift coralskippers a run for their money.<br><br>So the Millennium Falcon should continue, as far as the Yuuzhan Vong were concerned, to look like an innocent freighter.<br><br>While he watched the Yuuzhan Vong maneuver, Han broad-cast to the enemy a series of queries and demands for information of the sort that might come from a nervous civilian pilot. He conducted a series of basic maneuvers designed to keep the coralskippers at a distance, maneuvers as sluggish and hesitant as if he were a fat, nervous freighter loaded with cargo. The nearest flight of coralskippers set<br>on a basic intercept c...</p><h2>Classic</h2><p>Britain&#x2019;s most trusted cook has been showing the nation how to make delicious, foolproof food for decades.

General Counsel and other inside lawyers have risen in quality, responsibility, power and status. Once second class citizens in corporations and the legal profession, they have become core members of top corporate management, equaling in importance the Chief Financial Officer and the finance function. Benjamin W. Heineman, Jr. has led that revolution in his nearly 20 years as the top lawyer at GE. In this analytic and prescriptive book, he describes the essence of that transformation and the modern role of inside counsel: the key functions, relationships, issues, problems and dilemmas, and argues for the role of inside counsel as lawyer-statesman, motivated not just by the desire for income but by broader values of integrity and corporate citizenship.</p><p>Benjamin W. Heineman Jr. is GE&#39;s former senior vice-president for law and public affairs and is currently a senior fellow at Harvard Law School and at Harvard&#39;s Kennedy School of Government."The transformation of the corporate legal department from a &#x201c;backwater&#x201d; into a premiere destination for ambitious lawyers to learn and grow their careers, in many ways forms the nub of what Heineman calls the Inside Counsel Revolution..... Heineman&#x2019;s book is not a memoir of his time inside GE or a history of the inside counsel movement. Rather, he offers a set of prescriptions for how GCs can maximize their role in a corporation. The book explicates the unique role that a general counsel can play to help a corporation meet its highest performance and maintain integrity. He draws on recent history to call out lawyers who have fallen down, or commend his colleagues who in his view have effected tough decisions.... in-house counsel bring a unique perspective and analysis that makes them a conscience [of the company], their views important and their role bigger than a bureaucratic function, he writes." ----Gabe Friedman, Bloomberg Big Law Business<br><br>&#x201c;Ben Heineman redefined the world of inside lawyers and corporate General Counsels. His book, The Inside Revolution: Resolving the Partner-Guardian Tension, provides a thoughtful and thought provoking analysis of the role General Counsels, and lawyers more generally, can and should play in business and society. Every lawyer working in or for a business should read this book. And every business leader who works with lawyers should read it. Ben&#x2019;s analysis will help them understand what to expect from their lawyers, as it also holds a mirror to what they should expect from themselves in handling the complex issues that define the modern corporate world.&#x201d; --Frank Blake, former Chairman and CEO, Home Depot<br><br>&#x201c;This powerful book explains how the inside counsel revolution has helped shape the role of responsible global companies and has transformed the legal profession. How should the corporation where you are general counsel deal with the use in China of the ultra-sound equipment it manufactures to carry out sex-selection abortions aimed at favoring boys over girls? What's an in-house lawyer to do when her duty as guardian of the corporation conflicts with her role as the CEO's lawyer and partner? On these issues and everything else &#x2015; from good citizenship, to managing the profit maximizing urges of outside law firms, to handling internal scandals, to managing risk, to dealing with laws and regulations that contradict each other once you cross a national border, to chiming in on appropriate executive compensation &#x2015; Ben Heineman, Jr. has provided the ultimate analysis of how corporations can, and should, function in a complex legal environment here and around the globe. More than that, he offers a fascinating set of examples of how it's done. Every board of directors should read this book &#x2015; and make not just their lawyers but their executives, too, study it and take an oath to live it.&#x201d;--Steven J.

Holston, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Merck &amp; Co.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a must read for any director of a public company. Ben Heineman, legendary GE GC, makes a compelling case that the General Counsel is an essential partner for boards and business leaders on core issues of performance, integrity and risk. The stories of right and wrong will stay with you for years.&#x201d; --Shelly Lazarus, Chairman Emeritus, Ogilvy &amp; Mather<br><br>&#x201c;Major international corporations have become quasi- public institutions impacting the thousands, if not millions, who are either employed by them, use their output, or are impacted by their functioning, worldwide.&nbsp;Inside legal counseling of their management requires a vast combination of talents:&nbsp;law, obviously, and sensitivity to public policy, governmental concerns, and most importantly, courage.&nbsp;Ben Heineman, the long-time leader of the inside counsel revolution, has that combination in abundance and brings to those attempting that counseling an aspirational model, and to the general reader, a fascinating glimpse of the tensions inherent in counseling the management of these unique institutions.&#x201d;--Ira M. Millstein, Senior Partner, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges<br><br>&#x201c;Based on his pioneering work in creating the modern corporate law department, lawyer-statesman-teacher Ben Heineman ably sets out the core rules that must guide lawyers of skill and integrity as they advise businesses striving to achieve sustainable strong long term performance. The challenges he faced and the lessons he learned&nbsp;provide an invaluable and practical vision&nbsp;for both inside lawyers and the external counsel who work with them.&#x201d;--John F. Olson, Partner, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher<br><br>&#x201c;Ben Heineman puts forth a vision of the modern General Counsel that is both aspirational and profoundly practical.&nbsp;Refreshingly candid about the challenges facing global companies today, The Inside Counsel Revolution shows why Heineman's &#x2018;lawyer-statesman' General Counsel is an indispensable member of a winning leadership team. A must-read for CEOs and boards of companies seeking high performance with high integrity.&#x201d;--Lynn Sharpe Paine, John G. McLean Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School<br><br>&#x201c;Ben Heineman, a renowned pioneer at GE, has written an extraordinary and definitive book on the role of the general counsel in companies today. It offers rich insights not only for those of us who serve in these positions, but for business people who must operate at the intersection of business, law, public policy, and corporate responsibility.&#x201d;--Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer, Microsoft Corporation<br><br>&#x201c;No one understands better the critical role General Counsel play in assuring the success of global corporations than Ben Heineman, the former GC of GE.

It was a brilliant summer afternoon. He was not wearing his governor's hat, and the sunlight sifted through the maze of the oak branches and illuminated his gray hair like a silver crown.</p> <p>A monk, whom I had never seen before, asked to read my face.</p> <p>"How extraordinary!" He lowered himself to look into my eyes. "I have never seen a face with such perfection, a design so flawless and filled with inspiration. Look at his temple, the shape of his nose and eyes. This face bears the mission of Heaven."</p> <p>I wanted to smile. I had fooled him. I was Father's second daughter, and his favorite. He often dressed me in a boy's tunic and treated me as the son he did not have. Mother was reluctant to go along with the game, but I considered it a great honor.</p> <p>"It is a pity, however, that he is a boy," the monk said as people came to surround us.</p> <p>"A pity?" Father asked, his voice carrying a rare shade of confusion. "Why is that, Tripitaka?"</p> <p>I was curious too. How could a girl be more valuable than a boy?</p> <p>"If the child were a girl, with this face"-�the monk, Tripitaka, watched me intently-�"she would eclipse the light of the sun and shine brighter than the moon. She would reign over the kingdom that governs many men. She would mother the emperors of the land but also be emperor in her own name. She would dismantle the house of lies but build the temple of the divine. She would dissolve the kingdom of ghosts but found a dynasty of souls. She would be immortal."</p> <p>"A woman emperor?" Father's mouth was agape. "How could this be possible?"</p> <p>"It is difficult to explain, Governor, but it is true. There would be no one before her and none after."</p> <p>"But this child is not of the imperial family."</p> <p>"It would be her destiny."</p> <p>"I see," Father said, looking pensive. "How could a woman reign over the kingdom?" Father was asking the monk, but he stared at me, his eyes glistening with a strange light.</p> <p>"She must endure."</p> <p>"Endure what?"</p> <p>"Deaths."</p> <p>"Whose?"</p> <p>Tripitaka did not answer; instead, he turned around to look at the reception hall through the moon-�shaped garden entrance, where splendid murals and antique sandalwood screens inlaid with pearls and jade covered each wall. Leaning against the wall were shelved precious ceramic bowls and cups, a bone relic of Buddha-�Mother's most valued treasure-�and a rare collection of four-�hundred-�year-�old poems. In the center of the hall stood the object all Father's guests envied-�a life-�size horse statue made of pure gold, a gift from Emperor Gaozu, the founder of the Tang Dynasty who owed his kingdom to Father.</p> <p>Tripitaka faced Father again, gazing at him like a man watching another drowning in a river yet unable to help.</p> <p>"I shall take my leave now, respected Governor. May fortune forever protect you. It is my privilege to offer you my service." He pressed his hands together and bowed to leave.</p> <p>What I did next I could never explain. I ran to him and tugged at his stole. I might have only meant to say farewell, but the words that slipped from my mouth were "Wo men xia ci chong feng."</p> <p>We shall meet again.</p> <p>Tripitaka's eyes widened in surprise. Then, as though he had just understood something, he nodded, and with a deep bow, he said, "So it shall be."</p> <p>Any other child my age would have felt confused or at least awkward. Not me. I smiled, withdrew, and took Father's hand.</p> <p>After that day, I was not to wear a boy's garment again, and Father began to draft letters and sent them to Emperor Taizong, Emperor Gaozu's son, who had inherited the throne and resided in a great palace in Chang'an. When I asked him the purpose of the letters, Father explained there was a custom that every year the ruler of the kingdom chose a number of maidens to serve him. The maidens must come from noble families and be older than thirteen. It was a great honor for the women, because once they were favored by the Emperor and became high-�ranking ladies, they would bring their families eternal fame and glory.</p> <p>Father said he would like me to go to the palace.</p> <p>He devoted himself to teaching me classical poems, history, calligraphy, and mathematics, and every night, before I went to bed, he would ask me to recite Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Oftentimes I went to sleep mumbling, "All warfare is based on deception..."</p> <p>Days went by, then seasons and years. When I was twelve, one year before Emperor Taizong would summon me, Father took me to our family's grave site. He looked to be in high spirits, his footsteps light and his head held high. He told me old stories of how he, the wealthiest man in Shanxi Prefecture, had funded the war of Emperor Gaozu when he decided to rebel against the Sui Dynasty, how when the Emperor was betrayed and forced to flee, Father opened the gates of our enormous home to accommodate his army, and how, after the war was won, Emperor Gaozu proposed the marriage between Father and Mother, cousin of an empress, daughter of a renowned noble faithful to the empire that had perished.</p> <p>His long sleeves waving, Father showed me the undulating land that stretched to the edge of the sun-�his land, my family's land. "Will you promise to safeguard our family's fortune and honor?" he asked me, his eyes glittering.</p> <p>Clenching my fists, I nodded solemnly, and he laughed. His voice melted into the warm air and echoed on the tops of the distant cypresses.</p> <p>The pleasure of pleasing him wrapped around me when I caught a pair of yellow bulbous eyes peering out of the bushes. The forest fell still, and all the chirping and rustling vanished. A shower of leaves, fur, and red drops poured down from the sky, and a scream pierced my ears. Perhaps it came from me, or Father, I was not sure, for everything turned black, and when I came to my senses, I was at the table with Mother and my two sisters, eating rice porridge with shredded pork.</p> <p>One of our servants rushed into the reception hall, his chest heaving and his face wet with perspiration. There had been an accident, he said. Father had fallen off a cliff and died.</p> <p>On the day of his funeral, a feeble sun blinked through the opaque morning haze that hovered above the mountain tracks. Slowly, I walked toward his grave. A blister broke on my toe, but I hardly felt it. In front of me, a priest wearing a square mask painted with four eyes hopped and danced, and near him, the bell ringers shook their small bells. The tinkling faded to the distant sky but lingered in my heart. Desperately, I searched my mind to find any clue that might hint at the nature of Father's death, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not remember the details of the day he had died. I knelt, my face numb and my hands cold, as the hearse bearers pushed Father into the earthen chamber, burying him.</p> <p>I thought my life was over. I did not know it had just begun.</p></p><h2>The Blue Cliff Record</h2><p><i>The Blue Cliff Record </i> is a translation of the <i>Pi Yen Lu </i>, a collection of one hundred famous Zen koans accompanied by commentaries and verses from the teachings of Chinese Zen masters.

Even so, many writers are stymied in getting their books published, never mind gaining significant attention for their ideas&#x2015;and substantial sales. This is the book editors have been recommending to would-be authors. Filled with trade secrets, <em>Thinking Like Your Editor</em> explains:</p><p>� why every proposal should ask and answer five key questions;</p><p>� how to tailor academic writing to a general reader, without losing ideas or dumbing down your work;</p><p>� how to write a proposal that editors cannot ignore;</p><p>� why the most important chapter is your introduction;</p><p>� why "simple structure, complex ideas" is the mantra for creating serious nonfiction;</p><p>� why smart nonfiction editors regularly reject great writing but find new arguments irresistible.</p><p>Whatever the topic, from history to business, science to philosophy, law, or gender studies, this book is vital to every serious nonfiction writer.</p></p><p><p><strong>Susan Rabiner</strong> is the former editorial director of Basic Books.

Now come Rabiner, former Basic Books editorial director turned agent, and her husband, Fortunato, a freelance book editor and writer, covering some of the same territory, but also breaking new ground. Wannabe authors might be shocked to hear that a fine writing style usually plays only a tiny role in whether a proposal becomes a book. Instead, according to the authors, the freshness of ideas and the size of the potential audience drive the process the first three rules of book publishing, as stated here, are "audience, audience, audience." In part one, on submissions, the authors discuss how to put together a book proposal and, without sounding self-serving, whether to work through an agent or go solo. In part two, they move to the writing process. Especially welcome here is their discussion of research undergirding all writing: authors and publishers, they note, sometimes become too lax about accuracy in nonfiction. Part three discusses how authors and editors (both in-house and freelance) can work together well. They offer a necessary tonic in advice about the importance of establishing a good relationship with the editor from day one that includes an author understanding that the editor's world doesn't revolve around one book. A sample proposal accompanied by a sample chapter round out the book nicely. Hopeful writers will be the primary audience for this title, and they will find useful advice on every page, but a secondary audience could include avid consumers of nonfiction who want to understand why some ideas reach book form while others do not. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Simple Graces: Charming Quilts and Companion Projects</h2><p><p>Favorite author Kim Diehl is back with an all-new collection of distinctive pieced and appliqu�d designs!

Unfortunately, he succeeded primarily because he and his followers were the only Druids to survive Paranor&#x2019;s fall during the Second War of the Races. Bremen is best known for his role in creating the legendary Sword of Shannara, a magic-imbued weapon he designed to defeat the Warlock Lord. <br><br>Abandoned by his parents shortly after birth, Bremen was raised by his grandfather, a skilled metalworker, who was probably responsible for both the boy&#x2019;s understanding of metallurgy and his dedication. Always searching for knowledge, Bremen was a student of history and ancient tongues, disciplines that made him an ideal candidate for the Druid Council. <br><br>He joined the council as a young man and became active in assisting in the evolution and development of the Races. Over time, he watched as the Druid Council began to pull back from the rest of the world, disillusioned by its failure to re-create the old sciences.<br><br>Frustrated by the setbacks, Bremen began to look to magic as a possible alternative. In his early journal entries, now part of the Druid Histories, Bremen wrote: &#x201c;Magic could provide a more manageable and durable form of power than that found through science. It has untapped potential beyond that of the sciences, even at the levels of scientific advancement found in the Old World.&#x201d;<br><br>At that time, the study of the arcane arts was permissible but discouraged. Magic was to be treated as a curiosity only, not a serious discipline. One group of Druids had already been exiled for their insistence on the use of magic as a tool to make the Druids the masters of all the Races. Bremen was warned against traversing the same path. The fact that magic had been used in the First War of the Races to ill effect did nothing to help his cause. He wrote, &#x201c;It is quite unnatural to me to discard a possibility simply because it has once failed. Do we discard science because we have failed to re-create the wonders of the Old World? Of course not. Why then discard magic just because it was once blatantly misused? If we discard every possibility that is not immediately successful, we are left with no possibilities at all.&#x201d; He believed that magic could be harnessed and controlled with enough discipline and training. <br><br>A few of his fellows apparently agreed with him, but they were in the minority. Unwilling to risk censure, they backed away from the matter. Bremen did not. Eventually his insistence on considering magic a valid and serious alternative to science earned him banishment from the council.<br><br>After his banishment, Bremen traveled to the Westland to study with the Elves, where he lived for many years. He believed the Elven libraries, which had the greatest collection of ancient writings in lost Elven dialects, held the secret to understanding the old magic from the time of Faerie. The Elves embraced Bremen and his search, since they too were interested in rediscovering abilities that had been lost. Certain magics, such as some degree of the Druid Sleep, were skills Bremen already practiced. But with his knowledge of ancient tongues, he was able to uncover treasures of magical lore and decipher otherwise discarded texts that increased his knowledge and abilities far beyond what he would have gained at Paranor. <br><br>Inspired from his years of success with the Elves, Bremen left them to travel to other lands, seeking whatever lost bits of magic he could find, in much the same way as the early Druids had searched out the texts and lore related to the Old World sciences. According to his journals, he found an amazing amount of lost magic, though none as greatly concentrated or as highly developed as that within the Westland. In many cases, the magic he found was completely foreign to those who used it. <br><br>At some point in his travels, probably while in the Southland, Bremen began to suspect that the First War of the Races had not actually been organized by the Race of Men who appeared to have started it. He found evidence that the leader&#x2013;referred to only as Brona, which means &#x201c;master&#x201d; in Gnome dialect&#x2013;who had long been thought by the Druids of his order to be a mythic figurehead, was in fact a real being. Bremen suspected he was the leader of the Druids who had broken from the council and renounced their brotherhood over the question of magic many years before. He also found evidence that Brona was still alive, despite the impossible number of years that had passed, and was planning another assault on the Four Lands.<br><br>Unlike the rest of the Druids, Bremen had no trouble believing Brona could still be alive, because his own life had been lengthened beyond a natural span by his use of the Druid Sleep. But he knew he would have to have proof before the council would believe him.<br><br>He spent the next several years tracking the elusive Brona, going so far as to travel to the Skull Kingdom. Upon his return to Paranor, both Bremen and his information were rejected by the council. He left with only the few who believed his warning of impending attack. Shortly after his visit, Paranor fell to the armies of the Warlock Lord, betrayed from within. Bremen and those who left with him&#x2013;the Dwarf Warrior Druid Risca, the Elf Tay Trefenwyd, and the apprentice Mareth&#x2013;were the only survivors of the order. <br><br>Before he left, Bremen provided the magic that saved the Druid Histories from the invaders. The opened portion of the Druid Histories also credits him for preventing a long-term occupation by the Warlock Lord by triggering the magic of the Druid&#x2019;s Well.<br><br>By default, the death of the Druids left Bremen as the acting High Druid. But while he did rescue the Elit Druin after Paranor&#x2019;s fall, he never formally accepted the title. He used the medallion in the forging of the Sword of Shannara, the magical weapon used to end the Second War of the Races and the War of the Warlock Lord.<br><br>Of the Druids who followed Bremen from Paranor, only Mareth survived the war. She declined to complete her training as a Druid, leaving Bremen as the last of the Druids, even as he was the first to successfully balance magic with the good of the Races. He adopted a young man known only as Allanon, whom he had befriended during the war, and took him as apprentice, heir, and eventually son. <br><br>Paranor vanished only a few years after the war, and some scholars now believe that Bremen, with his knowledge of magics, was responsible for that disappearance.<br><br>While many consider Bremen to have died approximately three years after the end of the Second War of the Races, Allanon&#x2019;s journal records that he did not die, but instead &#x201c;doomed himself to an existence of half-life that may not end for all eternity&#x201d; by entering the mysterious Hadeshorn. This interpretation is also found within the diaries of Brin Ohmsford, where she records seeing an apparition that was identified as Bremen while at the Chard Rush, decades after Bremen&#x2019;s supposed death.</p><h2>A Wallflower Christmas</h2><p><br><br><p><i>The Wallflowers are four young ladies in London who banded together in their wild and wickedly wonderful searches for true love.

To reject this aspiration would be to will a disharmony in the universal fabric, and would be at least as great as a catastrophe as the defects which it might seem to avoid.

In this state, he was said to heal many of the people who came seeking his counsel with his recommendations for medical treatment. Cayce soon began to talk about spiritual notions such as Atlantis, reincarnation, dreams, astrology, and more. He would also predict some of the more astounding events of the twentieth century, such as World Wars and the Great Depression.</p><p><i>The Washington Post </i>wrote: "His words have inspired faith in spirituality, which for many people is more powerful than science." Called the "sleeping prophet" and "America's greatest psychic," Cayce, who died in 1945, may have been the first to usher in what is now known as the New Age Movement. More than fifty years after his death, his work continues to influence our lives in powerful new ways.</p>Awakening Your Psychic Powers <br> Part I THE PSYCHIC IMAGINATION 1 IMAGINE BEING PSYCHIC <i>The study from the human standpoint, of subconscious, subliminal, psychic, soul forces, is and should be the great study for the human family, for through self man will understand its Maker when it understands its relation to its Maker, and it will only understand that through itself, and that understanding is the knowledge as is given here in this state.</i> EDGAR CAYCE reading no. 3744 <i></i> <i></i> <i></i> <i></i> <i></i> <i></i> <i></i>4 <i></i> <i></i>1 &nbsp; <br> <i>People who go into this without spiritual aspirations should be warned that unless they remain open-minded about the possibility of being led into deeper meanings of life, their experience will almost certainly turn out to be a blind alley. For people who covet psychic potency out of profit and power, my advice is unequivocal: either develop higher motivation or drop the whole business at once. The consequences of deliberate misuse of these abilities can be disastrous.</i> ARTHUR FORD WHEN I LIE ON my back on a warm summer's night and gaze up at the spectacle of the stars, my mind naturally floats upward into the enormity of the universe and I seem to merge with the stars. This earthen platform of our planet, usually such a solid foundation, becomes an ever-shrinking, wobbly pebble in the huge, glittering blackness of space. My imagination, and I with it, expand into the infinite. I am engulfed in a tingling chill. Overwhelmed, I suddenly snap back to solid earth. But, I ask myself, what happened? Was what I sensed really true? Was it really possible that my mind could rise and join the stars in heaven? As I ponder this mystery, I know I am not alone. The Native Americans, for example, have a tradition that they came from the stars and to the stars they will return. What enshrouded secret of their sacred imagination links them with the stars? Another traveler, the English "imagineer" Olaf Stapleton, shared his psychic journey into space with us in his book <i>Star Maker</i>. His mind encountered not only other worlds, but was able to commune with other minds, travelers all in a multidimensional universal consciousness. In an attempt to keep us grounded on earth, he called his account "science fiction." Nevertheless, in the guise of such fiction, the imagination is the first pioneer; science and technology then follow, building concrete steps for all to climb. The imagination is an unbounded traveler, often returning with surprising souvenirs to lure successive generations of adventurers. To the stars we once visited only in our dreams and in our imagination, we now sent rockets and spacecraft. A PSYCHIC PROBE OF OUTER SPACE In December 1973 <i>Pioneer 10'</i>s observations about the planet Jupiter began to reach NASA scientists, who were millions of miles away on earth. Some of its observations contradicted astronomers' long-held assumptions about this revered planet. <i>Pioneer 10'</i>s discoveriescame as no surprise, however, to two men who had "seen" Jupiter nine months earlier. In an experiment organized by the Stanford Research Institute, two gifted psychics, Ingo Swann and Harold Sherman, traveled psychically to Jupiter while scientists recorded their impressions. Swann was in California, Sherman in Arkansas. Their impressions were amazingly similar to each other, and opposed to scientific speculation: both visualized a deadly radiation ring around Jupiter and an upper atmosphere of colorful frozen crystals; they said that the planet itself was very warm, but was whipped by violent windstorms. <i>Pioneer 10'</i>s data later contradicted the scientists' speculation, and confirmed the amazing accuracy of the atmospheric observations of Swann and Sherman, our first psychic astronauts. About a year later, they repeated their feat on a "visit" to Mercury. Again, they gave similar reports on what they had seen. Moreover, when the data from NASA's <i>Mariner</i> 10 space probe began to reach earth from Mercury, it contradicted conventional scientific speculation and confirmed the psychics' observations. Scientists had assumed that Mercury was too hot to support an atmosphere and that it revolved too slowly to have a magnetic field. But the two psychics sensed a thin atmosphere, as well as a magnetic field. Another astounding correspondence between the reports of the psychics and the data from <i>Mariner</i> 10 was the discovery of a helium "tail" coming out of Mercury and heading away from the sun. In <i>To Kiss Earth Goodbye</i>, Swann describes the excitement he felt when newspapers printed descriptions of Mercury that were much like his own psychic impressions. Can you imagine traveling psychically to another planet? How do you imagine that these two psychics made the trip? Words like "travel," of course, suggest physical movement. Swann describes the psychic probe into outer space as an experiment in "out-of-body travel," suggesting psychic movement through space. In an out-of-body experience, our consciousness appears to leave our physical body--we may see our body lyingmotionless below. In this extremely liberated state, travel to distant places is possible. Is this what Swann did? Perhaps, instead of "traveling," Swann expanded the range of his awareness beyond the bounds of his body and near vicinity to include the distant planets. Or perhaps he saw into the future, and examined the reports of the NASA spacecraft as they were analyzed by scientists. Either interpretation assumes a considerable psychic feat. Yet how we imagine the operation of psychic awareness will prove quite important. BECOME AN INSTANT PSYCHIC Imagine, if you will, that you can take a pill that will make you instantly psychic. Suddenly, you are able to experience the world from the point of view of people nearby; you know their thoughts, feel their feelings. What would that be like? In a study conducted by Charles Tart, Ph.D. (a psychology professor at the University of California at Davis and a long-time researcher of psychic phenomena), a group of college students and residents of a community in California were asked to contemplate taking such a pill. Their reactions were mostly negative. The most frequently expressed worry concerned lack of control--people were afraid of becoming overloaded, of being continually bombarded with information from other people's minds. One person thought that he would pick up on other people's dreams and not be able to sleep. Many expressed concern about such negative side effects as being driven crazy by the experience, and needing to retreat to a place of solitude. Others worried about being confused--not knowing how to tell whose thoughts they were getting, or-even worse--not being able to distinguish their own thoughts from those of others. That possibility was particularly scary. Have you ever walked into a roomful of people and felt the "bad vibes" in the room? During meetings at work, for example, you can tell that something is wrong--people are upset, something is not right. That'salmost like mind reading. Would you like to know more, to be even more psychic in a situation like that? What would that be like? The following imaginary account of a mind-reading experience, inspired by Dr. Tart's "pill," illustrates what might happen: I look over at Martha, and I begin to feel her anger. Now I can also hear her thoughts, the cursing and the accusations that are going through her mind. As I tune in more closely, I feel the frustration behind the anger--the hurt feelings and the disappointment. I also experience some of her memories, and understand the personal context that is making this frustration so important at this particular meeting. The patterns in her life, how she dealt with frustrations and anger in the past, and how her self-esteem was affected by frustrations--all this flashes into my mind. I also tune into her body. Her heart is pounding faster, and I can feel the heart pressing against the resistance in the arteries that are clogged with cholesterol. I can sense her blood pressure rising. I get an image that, somewhere down the road, a heart attack is in store for her as a result of the food she eats and her patterns of frustration and anger. My heart goes out to her, and I wish that she could relax. But I also sense her fear. Relaxing at this moment would seem threatening. She doesn't want to lower her defenses, so she feels trapped in her cage of anger and resentment. I know all this and more in a split second. My eyes move to Bob, sitting next to Martha. I can see what his life is like, and how it affects him in this meeting. But just then Fred begins to speak, and the tone of his voice expresses volumes of information--in the pitch and the rhythm of his speech I can sense his nervousness and his attempt to take control of a sticky situation; from the tentativeness and forced gentleness of the words I can hear how he is attempting to deal with stress. So while I am looking at Martha's face and seeing her life unfold before me, I am also experiencing the sounds of Fred's voice, and his life is also unfolding before me. It is a bit confusing, to say the least. I want to regain some focus, as I have my own business to bring up and feelings to express about this meeting. But with all this other information I'm getting about the people in the room, Iknow that I will feel the impact of my own behaviors and viewpoints upon their goals, desires, and feelings. I just don't know how I'm going to be able to process all this and still function at my own job. I'm going to try to tune out some of the noise and focus on my own objectives. This person feels overwhelmed and confused. Concentrating so much on the feelings of other people makes it difficult to stay in touch with his own thoughts and goals. Fortunately, he is making an attempt to take control by focusing the gift and turning down some of the input. Knowing what the other people at the meeting are thinking and feeling tends to inhibit action and makes the person a bit more cautious, less willing to do what is in his own self-interest. Such a concern for others could be a deterrent to the competitive spirit! A telepathic connection to people around you would certainly affect your relationship with them. Almost half the people in Dr. Tart's study expressed some doubt about their ability to handle such telepathic information maturely. What if they heard thoughts that they weren't supposed to know? Would they be able to resist taking advantage of someone whose thoughts they knew? What if they heard unkind thoughts about themselves, things that hurt their feelings, things they wish they hadn't heard? What would they do then? One man confessed to having a lot of nasty, mean, selfish thoughts, thoughts that might cause him to be rejected or to become the target of ridicule should other people become aware of them. It feels good to be loved in spite of our negative aspects, he said, but he wasn't so sure that he would be able to love people no matter what they were thinking. Others confided a similar worry. They wouldn't want their own thoughts read, and were not so sure that it was fair to read someone else's thoughts. To some it seemed like an invasion of privacy; others were concerned with encountering thoughts that might prove troublesome or upsetting. Mind reading could lead to concern over what other people think, which is already a problem for many people. Some people had positive responses as well, althoughthey were less specific. Dr. Tart pointed out that the most frequently mentioned positive remark was that mind reading would be "interesting," or something similarly vague. The most specific positive reaction was that mind reading might improve communication through increased empathy. One person suggested that by reading other people's thoughts you could come up with a lot of ideas that you'd never think of yourself-"you'd be a genius in no time." Are you surprised at the results of the survey, or sympathetic with the concerns? It is interesting that the people in the study were more likely to imagine negative consequences than positive ones, and to describe them in such vivid terms. Clearly, the negative side of psychic awareness seemed more real to them than the positive side. This response could have been due to the way the proposition was worded, of course, but this study is not the only source of evidence available that points to a fear of ESP. The fear seems to be real. In the course of this book, as we develop our psychic awareness, we will examine the sources of these fears and learn an approach that will help to overcome them. Few people in Dr. Tart's study had much to say about the positive use of psychic awareness. Instead, they envisioned themselves as passive victims of unscreened information. Perhaps it was because the ability was thrust upon them suddenly, with no time to prepare themselves for a new way of experiencing the world. Unfair as it may seem, psychic ability can appear in just that way. Consider the case of Peter Hurkos. Peter, a Dutch housepainter, was a member of the Netherlands' underground resistance to the Nazis during World War II. In his autobiography, Psychic, he describes how one day he fell from his ladder thirty feet to the ground. As he fell, his life flashed before his eyes. The last thing he remembers is the cry, "I don't want to die!" The next thing he knew, he was in a hospital. The doctor told him that it was a miracle he had survived such a severe head injury. Later that day, Peter noticed another patient in a bed nearby. To his astonishment, he found that he knew allabout this man. But he was a stranger! How was it possible? When the nurse examined Peter, he discovered that he knew things about her. When another patient said goodbye and wished him well, Peter found he was overcome with fear for him. He blurted out a warning to be careful. Peter shouted out that the man was a British agent and had been found out by the Germans and was to be killed. Two days later, the man was killed. Peter was confused by these impressions, which had come spontaneously with the conviction of truth. When he went home four months later, he hid in his room with his "curse," refusing to come out. He was bombarded with visual impressions that made him very quiet and very afraid. He was finally drawn out by an inexplicable urge to read the Bible. He realized there wasn't one in the house, and he had to go out and buy one. As he read, he began to feel better about his condition. He found that his power was increasing, and also troubling him less. He discovered that he had what he terms the "power of faith." He decided to go out and rejoin his colleagues in the underground movement. There he found he could turn his "curse" into a "gift," by aiding in the war effort in a unique way: one of his first accomplishments was to identify Nazi spies within the underground community. After the war, he developed his psychic ability to solve crimes and locate missing people. PSYCHICS VIEW THEIR ABILITY Being able to relate his psychic ability to biblical stories helped Peter Hurkos to conceive of it as the "power of faith." Being able to put his psychic ability to good use made it possible for him to value his gift and to develop it further. Like the subjects in Dr. Tart's survey, Peter was confronted with the sudden appearance of acute psychic sensitivity. Just as the subjects imagined, Peter experienced himself as an overwhelmed victim of an ability he could not control. Only when he developed a new perspective on his psychic gift, which gave him a sense of purpose and the ability ...</p><h2>Collage Couture: Techniques for Creating Fashionable Art</h2><p><b>Play dress-up with your art!</b><br><br>Collage has never been so fashionable!

The selections in this volume represent Thoreau at his best. Included in their entirety are <i>Walden</i>, his indisputable masterpiece, and his two great arguments for nonconformity, <i>Civil Disobedience</i> and <i>Life Without Principle</i>. A lifetime of brilliant observation of nature--and of himself--is recorded in selections from <i>A Week On The Concord And Merrimack Rivers, Cape Cod, The Maine Woods</i> and <i>The Journal</i>.</p><p>Walden describes Thoreau&#39;s domestic economy, the wildlife, the few visitors to his remote wooden hut, and his reflections on the quality of human life in an age of growing materialism and of a prevailing work ethic. It has become a poignant critique of the values of Thoreau&#39;s society which retains its relevance and extraordinary power today.Henry David Thoreau was born July 12, 1817 - "just in the nick of time," as he wrote, for the "flowering of New England," when the area boasted such eminent citizens as Emerson, Hawthorne, Whitman and Melville. Raised in genteel poverty - his father made and sold pencils from their home - Thoreau enjoyed, nevertheless, a fine education, graduating from Harvard in 1837. In that year, the young thinker met Emerson and formed the close friendship that became the most significant of his life. Guided, sponsored and aided by his famous older colleague, Thoreau began to publish essays in The Dial, exhibiting the radical originality that would gain the disdain of his contemporaries but the great admiration of all succeeding generations. <br><br>In 1845, Thoreau began the living experiment for which he is most famous. During his two years and two months in the shack beside the New England pond, he wrote his first important work, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), was arrested for refusing to pay his poll tax to a government that supported slavery (recorded in "Civil Disobedience") and gathered the material for his masterpiece, Walden (1854). He spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing and died, relatively unappreciated, in 1862.</p><h2>Sleeping Murder: Miss Marple&#39;s Last Case</h2><p>Soon after Gwenda moved into her new home, odd things started to happen.

The first version was written in 2006 and was the original Rainbow Diet although there have been many attempted copycats since. It is now regularly updated with the latest evidence and is widely acclaimed. Indeed, the first 15 reviews were all 5 Stars. &#34;Many people are using anti-cancer diets that just won&#39;t deliver. And research is now quite clear on this. This is sad because in the UK 11 top Doctors wrote to the Prime Minister just a few years ago saying that the colourful Mediterranean diet could prevent many of the chronic illnesses that beset the West, and urging him to adopt it in the country. The book goes further than just the colourful Mediterranean diet and prevention. It looks at how research shows it might correct chronic illness, including cancer. It compares the Rainbow Diet to other &#39;well-known&#39; diets; it presents research in simple easy-to-grasp English, and it will make you think again about what constitutes a healthy diet. It has been described by readers and doctors as the best book on diet available today. And it even tells you what foods you should or should not buy. I explore the Truth behind foods and diets, and how officialdom in the West - including Governments and Doctors - actually misleads us through a mixture of ignorance, vested interest and handed-down mythology. I review the research into everything you ingest from organic food to tap water and from good fats to low sugar. I even look at the true benefits of sunshine and how they interact with the foods.. And then I rebuild it all giving you the discipline and thoroughness - explaining that cancer is a multi-step process and how certain foods act on the different steps in the process. If you want a Diet to help you beat cancer you need to build a complete, disciplined diet that offers a range of benefits across a range of foods.</p><p></p><h2>Sign-posts in a Strange Land</h2><p>A collection of essays explores such issues as the art of writing novels, the Civil War, semiotics, the physician as novelist, faith, abortion, the future of the Church, movie magazines, and education</p><p><p><b>Walker Percy </b>wrote several books, many of them bestsellers, and is considered one of the greatest American writers of our time.</p>A pungent, revealing collection of lectures, essays, and interviews--some previously published in Harper's, The Georgia Review, etc.--by the late novelist (d. 1990). Percy was a quintessentially American writer with a voice of his own that was never compromised. His observation that the purpose of the novel is to give pleasure can be applied to this work as well. The nonfiction has a droll, dry, carefully laid-back honesty that shares something important with such masters of American English as Russell Baker, James Thurber, and Mark Twain; but Percy can also be as intense as Graham Greene in the earnestness of his Catholicism. He wrote novels with plenty of thought-content, and his nonfiction has plenty of storytelling. He writes about science, linguistics, literature, and the South, in ascending order of success, and while he is no threat to Chomsky and his successors, his essay on bourbon puts him up there with Flann O'Brien on the subject of whiskey. The title of his 1957 essay ``The Coming Crisis in Psychiatry'' is prescient, as are his queries into a profession that has since splintered in all directions. This is diligent, unassuming writing, always as clear and simple as the subject will allow, and sometimes deadly. It does not have the brooding elegance of his best fiction, but it has a stubborn integrity and a sense of the future. Always, Percy strives to keep in balance a very real spiritual talent, the abstract theories of science in which he was trained (as a doctor), and the precise, forgiving sense of human frailty in which the best southern writing is grounded. Percy was that rarest of creatures, an educated gentleman, a true man of the humanities; like the bourbon he writes about, he has a complex, heady flavor all his own. A good book to travel with. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

We encounter a kaleidoscopic range of artists. There are legendary figures&#x2013;Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Willem de Kooning, Joseph Cornell, Andy Warhol, and Donald Judd&#x2013;as well as still undervalued ones, such as the galvanic teacher Hans Hofmann, the lyric expressionist Joan Mitchell, the adventuresome realist Fairfield Porter, and the eccentric thinker John Graham. We encounter, too, the writers, critics, patrons, and hangers-on who rounded out the artists&#x2019; world. Jed Perl helps us see what the artists were creating and understand how they confronted an exploding art audience. And he makes clear how the economic boom of the late 1950s and the increasingly enthusiastic response to Abstract Expressionism ushered in the rapacious art world of the 1960s and the theatricality of Pop Art. <br><br>Artists drew strength from the dizzying onslaught of Manhattan, and produced a tidal wave of new forms. These included Hofmann&#x2019;s brazen flourishes of color; Pollock&#x2019;s quicksilver skeins of paint unfurling panoramic arabesques; and the crushed, jagged, turning-back-on-itself calligraphy of de Kooning&#x2019;s gnomic alphabets. And there was much more: Burgoyne Diller&#x2019;s levitating rectangles; Nell Blaine&#x2019;s explosive renderings of quotidian scenes; Ellsworth Kelly&#x2019;s extraordinary simplifications, suggesting sails or semaphores. <br><br>A brilliant tapestry of social history, biographical portraiture, and criticism, <i>New Art City</i> illuminates a revolutionary, unprecedented time and place in American culture.</p><p>Jed Perl was born in New York City in 1951. He received a BA from Columbia College and studied painting at the Skowhegan School in Maine. <br><br>He was a contributing editor to <i>Vogue</i> in the 1980s and has been the art critic for <i>The New Republic</i> since 1994. Among his books are <i>Paris Without End: On French Art Since World War I</i> and <i>Eyewitness: Reports from an Art World in Crisis</i>. He lives in New York City with his wife, the painter Deborah Rosenthal.THE PAINTER AND THE CITY<br><br>I<br><br>&#x201c;Mitcha, why aren&#x2019;t you home painting?&#x201d; This was what Hans Hofmann said to Joan Mitchell when he saw her out walking her dog early one morning in the paint-happy 1950s. Hofmann was in his seventies and Mitchell was turning thirty. She had studied with him briefly, in the school he had run in Manhattan since 1933. And like so many other artists of her day, she had felt the casually messianic impact of this man who was thickly built, with a large, powerful head and an orator&#x2019;s way of using his arms and hands to underscore a dramatic point. In the 1950s Hofmann and his wife, Miz, were living in a fifth-floor walk-up on Fourteenth Street, not far from his school, which was on Eighth Street, and Mitchell worked in several studios in the neighborhood. Hofmann and Mitchell would run into each other in Washington Square Park, that patch of green dominated by the famous triumphal arch, and all around them<br><br>Was Greenwich Village, with its extraordinary cache of nineteenth-century domestic architecture and its occasional modern storefronts and its faded fascination. The Washington Square of Henry James&#x2019;s story, with its Old New York gentility, had vanished long ago. For half a century the neighborhood had been home to bohemians who placed their hopes in socialism or in art-for-art&#x2019;s-sake, and by now the artists and writers sometimes seemed to be outnumbered by the tourists in search of a glimpse of the vie de boh�me. All of this was an amazingly comfortable backdrop for Hofmann and Mitchell and their friends, who walked along those familiar Village streets, immersed in their own glorious reimaginings of art and life and New York City, secure in the knowledge that they would make everything new.<br><br>Hofmann, a painter and teacher who laid out the principles of modern art in a sometimes nearly impenetrable German accent, could have been Mitchell&#x2019;s grandfather. He could have been a father to Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, artists who had already racked up achievements that left Mitchell and her young friends awestruck. And yet there was an agelessness about Hofmann. Rudi Blesh, a writer who was as interested in ragtime and jazz as he was in the new American painting, observed that Hofmann &#x201c;paints spontaneously with fury that is a real fury even if it is cheerful rather than grim.&#x201d; For painters and sculptors of Mitchell&#x2019;s generation, who listened to Hofmann in his school or on a street corner or at a gallery opening, it was almost incredible to imagine how far he had traveled. And now Hofmann&#x2019;s rich and varied life&#x2014;which had begun in Bavaria in 1880 and had included long periods in two of the great European cities&#x2014;was coming to a climax in New York in the mid-century years, when the melting-pot city was reaching the boiling point. New York itself was incredible, &#x201c;really like a Byzantine city,&#x201d; according to de Kooning, who was thinking of a city of contrasts and contradictions, a city where people from all over the world came together. The thought was seconded by Robert Motherwell, a young painter who had begun to exhibit in the 1940s and who explained to the poet Frank O&#x2019;Hara that &#x201c;New York City is a Constantinople, a great Bazaar.&#x201d;<br><br>The Byzantine city was a trading city, a place of exchanges, of cross-fertilizations. Pat Passlof, another young painter, who had studied at Black Mountain, the experimental college in North Carolina, was back in New York in the fall of 1948 and found that the artists she knew created a Byzantine city within the Byzantine city. She said that her artist friends were as varied as &#x201c;the characters from a Russian novel. . . . There were Italians; there were Greeks; there were Egyptians and Dutch and Spaniards and Armenians and Russians and even two Icelanders.&#x201d; And they were all &#x201c;so extreme in their personal and national traits and philosophies, so shrewd in dialogue, so immersed in art, that conversation, even a chance encounter on the street, was complex&#x201d;&#x2014;and there were those street encounters again, encounters that we will be hearing about all through the mid-century years. Many of the artists Passlof was talking about had studied with Hofmann, and most of those artists would have agreed that what Hofmann, a tough-minded visionary, brought to New York were the secrets of modern art, of an art that exulted in essences and that sometimes seemed to have changed everything about art and that was now as old as Hofmann himself. He had been born a year before Pablo Picasso and two years before Georges Braque, both of whom he&#x2019;d known in Paris at the beginning of the century. Hofmann grew up in Munich, where his father was a minor government official. In the decade leading up to World War I, he had lived the artist&#x2019;s life in Paris, where he had been close to Robert Delaunay, one of the pioneers of abstract painting, and had drawn beside Matisse at a legendary school, La Grande-Chaumi�re. World War I forced Hofmann back to Munich. It was there, in 1915, that he had opened his first school and taught until the beginning of the 1930s, when, in response to the worsening political situation, he began to accept teaching offers in the United States, some of them from Americans who had earlier traveled to Germany to study with him.<br><br>In each of the world cities where Hofmann lived&#x2014;in Paris, in Munich, and, finally, in New York City&#x2014;he was passionately involved with drawing and painting. When he was alone in the studio, however, he had not always found it easy to let loose with paint. In Germany he had painted hesitantly if at all; he had become something of a custodian of Parisian discoveries, subsuming his own creative urges in his urge to bring the meaning of modern art to a younger generation. Only after he had settled in New York was Hofmann really able to jump back into painting. He had a one-man show with Paul Cassirer in Berlin in 1910, and no other solo exhibition until 1931, in San Francisco; in the late 1940s he began to show his paintings regularly in New York. His American years, all the way from the early 1930s to his death in 1966, were an expansive time in New York, and Hofmann contributed more than his fair share to the heat and brilliance of the city. He was a man with a romantic sense of the individual&#x2019;s at-an-angle relationship with society and a dialectician&#x2019;s belief that to flourish in the world you had to embrace a broad, grand struggle. And Hofmann found in the new city of art a place where his gifts were at last fully in play. &#x201c;If I had not been rescued by America,&#x201d; he announced in 1944, &#x201c;I would have lost my chance as a painter.&#x201d; As the New York years passed, Hofmann&#x2019;s painting&#x2014;which in the 1930s and 1940s included some boldly, exuberantly calligraphic canvases of that primal scene, the artist&#x2019;s studio&#x2014;became ever more daringly intuitive, until his knockabout abstract clashes of hot and cold colors and soft-edged and hard-edged forms were capable of telegraphing any emotion or impression, from black-midnight terror to summer&#x2019;s-day ecstasy.<br><br>The paintings that Hofmann produced in the 1950s and 1960s are a dazzle of color. While this is unabashedly painted color, with all the lurid force and crazy artificiality of the stuff that comes out of a tube, Hofmann somehow manages to use his electrically unnatural hues to create a whole variety of naturalistic effects. He excels at shimmers and halos and sparks and radiant glows, and he&#x2019;s terrific at suggesting a mysteriously effulgent darkness. He&#x2019;s also a master of textures, which in his work range from watercolored to impastoed, from cake-frosting smoothness to stucco-like roughness. Often in his painting, colors and textures are pushed to dissonant extremes, so that the artist&#x2019;s power is presented in perpetual, turbulent play. He knows how to achieve a beyond-analysis impact, as if we are seeing a brilliant sunset right after a fast-moving storm. Pompeii (1959) is a red painting, insistently vertical. The full cry of the red is opposed by rectangular forms, in magenta, cool lemon yellow, deep golden yellow, and bright light green. Other areas of the canvas have softer, darker edges. There&#x2019;s one large form in a blackish but frothy green, and there are a few small bits of blue. The painting is jazzy, swank, opulent. While you may miss some element of honest equivocation, there is no question that the painting&#x2019;s stentorian presence is unforgettable. Pompeii, which lives up to the volcanic history of the ancient Roman city, is one of many compositions in which the hyperbolic effects are paired with unabashedly metaphoric titles, such as Orchestral Dominance in Yellow, Golden Blaze, Moonshine Sonata, Summer Night&#x2019;s Bliss, Pre-Dawn, Lava, Towering Clouds, and Indian Summer. These works announce a new kind of free-flowing pictorial experience. The rapid-fire play of color and shape and texture incites wild metaphoric imaginings, until you hardly know where the ecstatically melodramatic experiences end and the beguilingly sensuous ones begin.<br><br>II<br><br>While mid-century New York did not produce a single quintessential artistic figure, Hofmann held a unique, almost talismanic position in that very complicated world, and it is good to linger with him for a while now, as we approach the Manhattan of the 1940s and 1950s, with all its crazy variety, with all its artists and dealers and museum people and collectors and critics and gallerygoers and museumgoers. The lectures that Hofmann gave in Manhattan in the late 1930s attracted an extraordinary roster of young New Yorkers, including Arshile Gorky and Clement Greenberg, and although in the early years Hofmann&#x2019;s school was not especially well attended, with perhaps a dozen or so students at a time, his underground fame was spreading very fast.

Thus it was that well into the 1970s, McIntosh County in backwoods Georgia remained a place where the black majority still had never elected one of their own to any county office, where black kids were bused away from the white school, and where the white county sheriff had his hand in every racket there was. <i>Praying for Sheetrock</i> is the saga of how, thanks to the leadership of a black shop-steward-turned-county-commissioner named Thurnell Alston, together with the aid of a cadre of idealistic Legal Services lawyers (Melissa Greene was one of their paralegals) this situation began to change. The story, written as grippingly as a novel, is charged with twists that only nonfiction can deliver; for example, Alston, for all the brave good he did, ultimately got caught in a federal sting and went to jail while the corrupt sheriff walked. This is, writes Greene, a story of "large and important things happening in a very little place.""A a monumental social history...Through a combinaton of oral history and interpretive narrative, Greene has created a work of great drama, a chorus of voices that is both disturbing and inspiring."<br>THE BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE<br>Somehow, the sweeping changes of the civil rights movement had bypassed rural McIntosh County, Georgia. In the 1970s, the white sheriff there still wielded all power; he controlled everyone and everything. It took one uneducated, unemployed black man with a passion for justice to take him on and win, changing life in McIntosh County forever. PRAYING FOR SHEETROCK is about that one man, his victory and his utlimate fall from grace.</p><h2>The Frontiersmen (The Old West)</h2><p>The Frontiersmen (The Old West) O&#39;Neil, Paul and Time-Life Books with text by Paul O&#39;Neil, of</p><p></p><h2>Heller With a Gun, The Louis L&#39;Amour Collection</h2><p>Tom Healy was in trouble.

Then King Mabry showed up. Although Tom didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t like the way he looked at Janice, he could see that Mabry made Barker uneasy. So Tom invited Mabry to join them.

In this blistering, personal account, world-famous economist Yanis Varoufakis blows the lid on Europe&#39;&#39;s hidden agenda and exposes what actually goes on in its corridors of power. Varoufakis sparked one of the most spectacular and controversial battles in recent political history when, as finance minister of Greece, he attempted to re-negotiate his country&#39;&#39;s relationship with the EU. Despite the mass support of the Greek people and the simple logic of his arguments, he succeeded only in provoking the fury of Europe&#39;&#39;s political, financial and media elite. But the true story of what happened is almost entirely unknown - not least because so much of the EU&#39;&#39;s real business takes place behind closed doors. In this fearless account, Varoufakis reveals all: an extraordinary tale of brinkmanship, hypocrisy, collusion and betrayal that will shake the deep establishment to its foundations. As is now clear, the same policies that required the tragic and brutal suppression of Greece&#39;&#39;s democratic uprising have led directly to authoritarianism, populist revolt and instability throughout the Western world. Adults In The Room is an urgent wake-up call to renew European democracy before it is too late.</p><p>Yanis Varoufakis is the former finance minister of Greece and the author of several international bestsellers. And the Weak Suffer What They Must?: Europe, Austerity and the Threat to Global Stability reveals the underlying problems that led to the Eurozone crisis and its ongoing catastrophic mishandling. Adults In the Room: My Battle with Europe&#39;s Deep Establishment is his explosive memoir of his time in goverment, which reveals what goes on behind the scenes in Europe&#39;s corridors of power. Talking To My Daughter About the Economy: A Brief History of Capitalism explains through vivid stories and easily graspable concepts what economics actually is and why it is so dangerous in the form of a letter to his teenage daughter. Born in Athens in 1961, Yanis Varoufakis was for many years a professor of economics in Britain, Australia and the USA before he entered government and is currently Professor of Economics at the University of Athens.

It is deeply personal and very well written&#34; * Financial Times * &#34;The most jaw-dropping segments are the accounts of phone calls and closed-door meetings - often verbatim, courtesy of his secret recordings - between ministers and technocrats ... We see duplicity and cynicism ruling supreme .. A convincing critique ... Our own government should take note&#34; * Daily Telegraph * &#34;This is a superbly written account of the struggle to alleviate the austerity imposed upon the Greek people by the eurozone. Greece, argues Varoufakis, has been put in a debtors&#39; prison and robbed of autonomy and dignity for the indefinite future. Critics would argue that he failed as finance minister in 2015 because he was insufficiently politic. More plausibly, he could never have succeeded, such were the vested interests arrayed against him. This outcome was - and is - a tragedy, because he was - and is - right.

(Selina Hastings). &#39;A bulging plum pudding of insider snippets&#39;, commented Robert Lacey. &#39;An overall portrait which may well be as close as anyone will ever get to the truth&#39;, said Craig Brown. And A.N. Wilson added admiringly, &#39;There is a small handful of British royal biographies which have acquired classic status ...It is a truly magnificent book. Hugo Vickers knows his subject through and through&#39;. Hugo Vickers has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Royal Family, and has had a fascination with the story of the Duchess of Windsor since he was a young man. There have been a number of books about this doomed couple (and Channel 4 is very interested in doing a programme based on Hugo&#39;s text), but this book brings a new perspective on the story by focussing on the later years of exile. While Vickers has his own theories about the Abdication itself, and he makes it very clear that Mrs Simpson did not lure the King from the throne, the drama of this narrative comes from the criminal exploitation of an old sick woman after the death of her husband. She was ruthlessly exploited by a French lawyer called Suzanne Blum. Some members of the Royal Family, like Mountbatten and the Queen Mother, don&#39;t emerge with much credit either. Using previously unpublished papers and other personal testaments, Hugo Vickers relates a tragic story which has lost none of its resonance over the years since the Duchess died in 1986.</p><p>Hugo Vickers was born in 1951 and educated at Eton and Strasbourg University. His books include Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece; Gladys, Duchess of Marlborough; Cecil Beaton; Vivien Leigh; Loving Garbo; Royal Orders; The Private World of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; and The Kiss, which won the 1996 Stern Silver Pen for non-fiction. He is an acknowledged expert on the Royal Family, appears regularly on television and has lectured all over the world. Hugo Vickers is married and has two sons and a daughter.&#34;A page turner... Hugo Vickers&#39; compelling account makes one feel that Wallis did the Queen a favour&#34; Literary Review &#34;With a lifetime&#39;s interest in the subject, Vickers knows everything there is to know about the Windsors ... The first half of Behind Closed Doors, as well as being an accumulation of evidence against Blum, is the story of a personal journey into the world of the Windsors in which Vickers quotes from nearly 40 years of his own diary entries. It is also a hugely entertaining account of the battle between biographers for ownership of their subject ... The book&#39;s second half is a biography of Wallis Simpson, nee Warfield. Vickers delves into her family tree with his accustomed detail and gives a realistic account of the end of her marriage to Ernest Simpson.&#34; Telegraph &#34;A definitively brilliant history of the whole story&#34; -- A.N.

The book takes advantage of oblique connections to reveal things that cannot be represented directly on stage.<br><br> Purcell has pioneered the technique of capturing reflections in antique mercury glass apothecary jars, resulting in haunting images that seem to move with the liquid quickness of ideas. These images are an attempt to capture Shakespeare's expansive imagination in action&#x2015;what Coleridge called his "myriad-mindedness": they take a visceral journey into the world of his plays. Witmore has paired each photograph with a short passage from Shakespeare's plays with an uncanny sense of the playwright's intent. 72 color illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Rosamond Purcell</strong> is the author of <em>Bookworm</em> and <em>Owls Head</em>. She lives in Medford, Massachusetts.</p><p><strong>Michael Witmore</strong> is a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>Photographer Purcell admits predilections for visual conundrums and for glass objects that led her to purchase old mercury-glass apothecary bottles&#x2014;double-walled, light-blocking containers, the inner walls of which are silvered like mirrors. The curved surfaces of both walls distort what they reflect, and the aging of the silvered interior one combines with the wear on the outer one to make them spontaneously &#x201c;create&#x201d; ambiguous imagery. When Shakespearean scholar Witmore suggested a project to marry the Bard&#x2019;s rich verbal imagery to photographs, Purcell took the bottles out in a meadow and started shooting. The resulting matches encourage finding the words&#x2019; denotations in the pictures, not vice versa, but the wonderful murk as well as the distortion that the bottles enforce on what they reflect spurs the viewing imagination as might multicolored clouds. The results look rather like the work of symbolist painters skipping over expressionism and plunging into abstraction, as if Arnold B�cklin, say, or Odilon Redon, was trying to be Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Huevos verdes con jam�n</h2><p>In this classic children&#39;s story, Yo Soy Juan (Sam-I-Am) is determined to make a friend eat a plate of green eggs and ham.

Renuka Singh, a student and friend of the Dalai Lama, brings together a sampling of his words for each day of the year in <i>The Path to Tranquility</i>. In her selections you can sense the intimate encouragement of the student-teacher relationship. The Dalai Lama's words are not distant platitudes or profound proclamations but rather small insights and patient exhortations to keep trying. "We can deny everything except that we have the possibility of being better." "As a spiritual trainee, you must be prepared to endure the hardships of being involved in a genuine spiritual pursuit." "Nothing is more important than guarding the mind." These thoughts are germane to practical cultivation, and pondering a daily passage is a great way to keep the mind coming back to its center. Take a page from the Dalai Lama, and set yourself on the path to tranquility. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>His Holiness the Dalai Lama, religious and temporal leader of Tibet and winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, is recognized internationally as a spiritual leader and peace statesman.

Noticing a remarkable similarity between their images, they agreed to documenttheir mornings by posting one photo to a shared blog every weekday for a year.

While clearly kindred spirits, the two women have met in person only once.

That's what it feels like to flip through <em>A Year of Mornings</em>, and even though the authors have set their sights on their own surroundings, you'll recognize in their photos a familiar, physical sense of joy experienced in daily rituals. Born out of a year-long visual blogging project, the book profiles passing early-morning moments at home shared between two women living 3,191 miles apart. What started as a meeting of two creative minds became a close friendship that went on to inspire a huge community of readers (whose participation in the project is paid tribute at the end with a month-by-month section of the authors' favorite posted comments). As the book progresses from season to season, you can see a kind of kindred vision taking shape between them, so much so that after a while it doesn't really matter which pictures are Stephanie's or which are Maria's. Their story is a welcome reminder that the opportunities to take notice of life's simple beauty are never as rare as you may think. <em>--Anne Bartholomew</em><br>To Which I Aspire, &#34;In a roundabout, blog-surfing kind of way today, I came across this: A Year of Mornings, 3191 Miles Apart.

Bill Bruford once called &#34;the godfather of progressive-rock drumming&#34; has been at the top of his profession for four decades, playing with Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Earthworks, and many more. The Autobiography is his memoir of life at the heart of prog rock, art rock, and modern jazz. It is an honest, entertaining, well-written account of life on the road and in the studio rubbing shoulders with the famous, the less famous, and the infamous, and creating an impressive tally of great music. A rock musician with the temperament of a classical musician who became a jazz musician, Bruford defies all the cliches about drummers. He says: &#34;You write what you have to write, you play what you have to play, because you can&#39;t sleep at night. If you can sleep at night, you shouldn&#39;t be doing this anyway.&#34; From time to time, at polite dinner parties, someone will ask Bill what he does. He replies that he is a musician. &#34;Yes, but what do you really do?&#34; retorts the enquirer. This unusual, funny, and insightful music memoir answers the question.</p><p>Bill Bruford&#39;s professional musical career began in 1968. He was a guiding light in the British Art Rock movement, recording and touring internationally with Yes and King Crimson from 1968-74.

At once forensic and intimate, <i>After Kathy Acker</i> traces the extreme discipline and literary strategies Acker used to develop her work, and the contradictions she longed to embody. Using exhaustive archival research and ongoing conversations with mutual colleagues and friends, Kraus charts Acker's movement through some of the late twentieth century's most significant artistic enterprises.</p><p>Beginning in her mid-teens, Acker lived her ideal of the Great Writer as Cultural Hero, and as Kraus argues, she may well have been the only female writer to succeed in assuming this role.

You've based a whole series of books on the horror of these parasitic alien creatures. Why do you think people are so scared of them? It can't be just a fear of death, right? Imagine, <i>Cardiac: A Horror Novel of Heart Disease</i>. I mean, it just doesn't have the same snap as <i>Infected</i>. So what's going on?</strong></p> <p>A. As humans, we have a universal fear of something getting inside of us, working against us, hurting us or even <i>killing us</i>. We also dread losing control, being manipulated to do things we don&#x2019;t want to do, losing our free will&#x2014; the amorphous fear of Big Brother, for example, or the ongoing fascination with regular folk turned into brain-hungry zombie hordes. A parasite that can turn you into a paranoid killer while at <i>the same time</i> eating you from within combines those terrors. </p> <p>My books resonate because the parasitic &#x201c;bad guy&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t something you can run away from, or lock your doors against. It gets <i>inside you</i>, becomes a part of you, and destroys who you are. Once you&#x2019;re infected, there is no escape. </p> <p><strong>Q. There is sometimes nothing quite as boring as a scientific paper. And that's a good thing. Science needs to focus on the details, relentlessly, in order to move towards the truth. So how do you draw from science to create fiction that people want to keep reading?</strong></p> <p>A. As important as science is to my books, I&#x2019;m always very aware that the driving force needs to be the <i>story</i>, not the <i>idea</i>. That&#x2019;s always been the essence of science fiction, using the experiences of characters we can connect with to convey a larger concept. In transmuting that approach into horror fiction, hard science provides realism and validity that makes the scary stuff even scarier: everything seems more frightening because the reader feels that <i>this could really happen</i>. Vampires are scary as hell, but there is a safety in that fear because we know (most of us do, anyway), that they don&#x2019;t exist. With science-based horror, the reader watches pieces being assembled, knows those pieces are <i>real</i>, and that makes for a different experience.</p> <p><strong>Q. You are writing science-based horror in an age of &#x2014; shall we say &#x2014; pseudoscience horror. Why do you stay away from the paranormal?</strong></p> <p>A. Paranormal horror is great and, as a <i>reader</i>, I enjoy it. As a <i>writer</i>, however, I naturally gravitate to telling stories that past the &#x201c;sniff test&#x201d; of something that could really happen, and could happen right now. </p> <p>If you have a super-powered Big Bad that can change reality with the wave of an ancient hand, then anything is possible and the rule-set can change at the author&#x2019;s whim. I can read those stories; I&#x2019;m just not adept at writing them. I&#x2019;m more comfortable telling a tale where the world around us is the world around us, not camouflage for a hidden realm where physics don&#x2019;t apply. </p> <p>In that way, I think of myself more as a thriller author using horrific elements than a &#x201c;horror author,&#x201d; which usually implies use of the supernatural and/or undead that have a scientific explanation. When my stories do drop a fantastic, unexpected element, I want my readers to be able to go back and think, &#x201c;This is perfectly inline with the rest of the story; I could have seen this coming but I missed it.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Q. You've mentioned in the past that my nonfiction book <i>Parasite Rex</i> influenced you. Just out of personal curiosity, what happened?</strong></p> <p>A. <i>Parasite Rex</i> was part of my original research for the first book in this series, <i>Infected</i>, and two facts in it blew me away. The first was that parasites make up <i>two-thirds</i> of the species on this planet, meaning that parasitism is the dominant survival strategy. Parasites <i>win</i>. </p> <p>The second thing was that parasites can, quite literally, mind-control their hosts and destroy the host&#x2019;s survival instinct. Talk about <i>true</i> horror: parasites can force hosts to commit suicide, either by leaving their natural environment, or by <i>making them attracted to their predators</i>. </p> <p>When I started applying what I learned in <i>Parasite Rex</i> to human hosts, it created disturbing, deeply unsettling possibilities &#x2014; as anyone who has read <i>Infected</i> can tell you.</p> <p><strong>Q. To complete the circle from nonfiction to fiction and back, do you find your novels can entice people to find out more about science? Are you a gateway drug for knowledge?</strong></p> <p>A. My first responsibility is to tell a well-structured story that doesn&#x2019;t &#x201c;cheat&#x201d; by making up new rules when it is convenient for the author. &#x201c;C&#x201d; is believable and possible because &#x201c;B&#x201d; was already done, and &#x201c;B&#x201d; seems real because we all learned about &#x201c;A&#x201d; in high school. When I do it right, the story feels complete and has a logical &#x2014; if completely over the top &#x2014; ending. That&#x2019;s what makes my readers happy.</p> <p>I feel my <i>second</i> responsibility, however, is to show just how damn cool science is. Many of my readers Google the seemingly far-out discoveries and technologies they find in my stories, and are shocked to learn these things actually exist. From there, I hope in my heart of hearts that they keep searching and keep learning. </p><b>Scott Sigler</b> is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of several novels, including<i> Infected, Contagious, Ancestor,</i> and <i>Nocturnal</i>.

But by listing the top 1,000 movies, as the editors of <i>The New York Times</i> have done with this fat, readable collection of reviews, you get to skip all that huffing and puffing about quality and head straight for the fun. With a little elbow room, there's space for ineffable stuff like <i>Mr. Hulot's Holiday</i> and <i>The Match Factory Girl</i>. Room, too, for the nuance-free <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i> and the free-falling <i>Die Hard</i> (which makes it, yep, right next to <i>Diner</i>). <i>Pillow Talk</i> squeezes in just one down from <i>The Piano</i>. What's really new about this book, though, is that the reviews have been culled from the <i>Times</i>'s archive--reaching back to 1931. So you can read Vincent Canby reacting to <i>Taxi Driver</i> in 1976, just days after first seeing it: "The steam billowing up around the manhole cover in the street is a dead giveaway. Manhattan is a thin cement lid over the entrance to hell, and the lid is full of cracks." Not bad for a guy on deadline. Bosley Crowther, who preceded Canby, fares less well, waving off <i>Rear Window</i> as Hitchcock's "new melodrama, " and <i>Psycho</i> with, "It does seem slowly paced." By contrast, Janet Maslin's more recent reviews hum and gush, unraveling the merits of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and <i>Lone Star</i>. At collected-Shakespeare size (999 pages), the title is probably too vast for schlepping around, but go ahead, try reading just one. With plenty of international selections, including usual suspects from France (Truffaut), Italy (Fellini), and Japan (Itami), as well as some unusual ones from Brazil, Mexico, India, and Czechoslovakia, there's enough canon fodder here for at least five "Top 100" books. <i>--Lyall Bush</i>Vincent Canby was film critic for the <i>New York Times</i> from 1969 to 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;He now writes the "Stage View" column for the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet Maslin has been a <i>Times</i> film critic since 1982.</p><h2>How to Restore Your Wooden Runabout (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p>Breathe life back into your classic wooden runabout with expert tips from restoration guru Don Dannenberg.

With three published books to his credit and a fourth nearly finished, he made the risky decision to try life as a full-time writer. <i>On Fire</i>, his first work of nonfiction, looks back on his life as a full-time firefighter. Unflinching accounts of daily trauma--from the blistering heat of burning trailer homes to the crunch of broken glass at crash scenes--catapult readers into the hard reality that has driven Larry Brown.<br><br>As firefighter and fireman-turned-author, as husband and hunter, and as father and son, Brown offers insights into the choices men face pursuing their life&#x2019;s work. And, in the forthright style we expect from Larry Brown, his diary builds incrementally and forcefully to the explanation of how one man who regularly confronted death began to burn with the desire to write about life.<br><br><i>On Fire</i> is a book in which an extraordinarily gifted writer looks back and reflects on the violence of his life as a fireman. Thoreau said it one way: &#x201c;However mean your life is, meet it and live it.&#x201d; Larry Brown says it another:<br><br><i>You have to meet the thing, is what it is . . . and for the firefighter it is fire. It has to be faced and defeated so that you prove to yourself that you meet the measure of the job. You cannot turn your back on it, as much as you would like to be in cooler air.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Larry Brown has an ear for the way people talk, an eye for their habits and manners, a heart for the frailties and foibles, and a love for their struggles and triumphs. His fireman&#x2019;s diary is a wonderful book.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Grisham, author of <i>The Firm</i> and <i>The Client</i><br><br>"Larry Brown is never romantic about danger and . . . in this book he goes through his life with the same meticulous attention with which Thoreau circled the woods around Walden Pond." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review.</i></p></p><p><b>Larry Brown</b> was born in Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he lived all his life. At the age of thirty, a captain in the Oxford Fire Department, he decided to become a writer and worked toward that goal for seven years before publishing his first book, <i>Facing the Music</i>, a collection of stories, in 1988. With the publication of his first novel, <i>Dirty Work</i>, he quit the fire station in order to write full time. (The nonfiction book&nbsp;<i>On Fire</i> tells the story of his many years as a firefighter.) Between then and his untimely death in 2004, he published seven more books.&nbsp;He was awarded the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for fiction and&nbsp;was the first two-time winner of the Southern Book Award for Fiction, which he won in 1992 for&nbsp;<i>Joe,&nbsp;</i>and again in 1997 for <i>Father and Son</i>. He was the recipient of a Lila Wallace-Readers Digest Award and Mississippi's Governor's Award For Excellence in the Arts. The story "Big Bad Love" became the basis for a feature film, as did his novel <i>Joe</i>.&nbsp;Brown brings to his first work of nonfiction the same no- nonsense style that makes his novels and short stories (Big Bad Love, 1990, etc.) so powerful and intense. This episodic memoir of his life as a firefighter is also a testament to family, courage, and hard work, and Brown isn't afraid to risk being sappy, albeit in a manly way. A self-taught writer, Brown supported himself and his family for 16 years as a fireman in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi. A veteran of the Marines, he found the same brotherhood in the station house, and also a similar test of muscle, brain, and heart. A firefighter can be ``a prick, a thief, a liar,'' but he can't be a coward. Each fire ``has to be faced and defeated,'' and you never ``forget death and pain, or fear.'' Brown sings the praises of his tools--the beauty of knots, hoses, and sirens. He inventories the back rooms, and re-creates the boredom of waiting as well as the pleasures of cooking for the boys and watching sex and violence on the VCR. But nothing beats the adrenaline rush of a call, whether to a burning building or a car wreck: Both require a reflex-like response, and the joy of saving lives cannot be equalled. Interspersed throughout the rambling narrative are anecdotes from Brown's life: his guilt over killing a mouse; his early joy in hunting and fishing; his love for his family and his squirrel dog. The funny tale of his temporary separation from his wife has all the hard-luck pathos of the author's best short stories. Brown confesses to drinking too much and to being otherwise content with his life. Yet he reluctantly abandoned firefighting to become a full-time writer--and he's done extraordinarily well at it since. A remarkable addition to the literature of work. This may not be the first book by a fireman--but it's one of the best. (First printing of 25,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From Anne Bradstreet to the Beats, from Native American chant and Shaker hymnody to Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, religion and spirituality have always been central to American poetry. In this unique anthology, world-renowned scholar Harold Bloom weaves a tapestry from the many strands of American religious experience and practice: the searching meditations of Puritan pioneers, the evangelical fervor of the Great Awakenings, the mystical currents of Transcendentalism, the diverse influences of the world religions that have taken root in modern America.<br><br>Spanning four centuries and more than 200 poets,&nbsp;<i>American Religious Poems</i>&nbsp;is a bountiful and moving gathering of voices that offers countless moments of inspiration, solace, meditation, and transcendence.

He is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Humanities at Yale University.To his long eminence as a poetry critic, Yale professor Bloom has more recently added the mantles of expert in comparative religion (<i>Jesus and Yahweh</i>, 2005) and all-around literary sage (<i>Genius</i>, 2003). This expansive anthology takes advantage of all three Bloomian reputations, gathering verse on Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, Native American spiritual, Transcendentalist and even agnostic themes, from 17th-century European colonists (one poet is Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island) to up-and-comers in contemporary verse. Pious readers will have no trouble finding high-quality poetry that confirms their beliefs&#x2014;from the monk Thomas Merton, the Anglican T.S. Eliot, the Jewish liturgical poet Esther Schor and the Louisiana-based Christian poet Martha Serpas. Yet from the 19th century to the present, from the decidedly heterodox Emily Dickinson forwards, the anthology often highlights the ways in which American spirituality has challenged all doctrines about who God is and what God does. Herman Melville speculates about the eternal feud between "ape and angel"; John Ashbery's "The Recital" tells us not to care "whether prayers were answered with concrete events," and the Libyan-born Khaled Mattawa questions Islamic custom. More than half of the book is taken up by 20th-century poets, who offer varied takes on what religion has come to mean in America. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was a little embarrassing to continually beg the bookstore owner to let me hold it, page through it, study it. I just wanted to touch it, stroke it, and once, when he wasn't looking, sniff it. But he didn't seem to mind my fixation. He's as big a book nerd as I am.<br><br> The owner kept the book inside a clear, locked glass case displayed on the shop's front counter, so it was pretty obvious he didn't want people touching it. And who could blame him? The book was exquisitely bound in vibrant red morocco leather. Rich gilding swirled along the spine, spelling out the title, author's name, and year of publication in fancy gold script. More gilding outlined the thick raised cords that lent gravitas to the already weighty tome.<br><br> In the center of the front cover was a brightly gilded rabbit wearing a topcoat. The well-dressed creature glanced down at a watch he held at the end of a chain, and he appeared nervous, as though he might be running late for some important event.<br><br> The fact that a gilded illustration could convey real emotion was pretty awesome, above and beyond the binding work. The first time I saw it, I checked the inside cover for the bookbinder and was thrilled to find the name George Bayntun of London. Favored by the late Queen Mary, Bayntun's bindery in Bath, England, was world renowned and was still operating to this day. I'd visited once and had come away starstruck.<br><br> On the back cover of the book was another elaborately raised figure in gold, an odd-looking woman wearing a crown and carrying a scepter. The red queen. She appeared headstrong and irate, as though she might order someone's head lopped off at any moment.<br><br> The book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, of course. This copy was a fairly hard-to-find version in excellent condition, with dark green-and-red-marbled endpapers and virtually no foxing on its clean white pages. It contained dozens of classic illustrations by the famous artist John Tenniel. The binding was tight and even. And I wanted it.<br><br> My name is Brooklyn Wainwright, and I'm a bookbinder specializing in rare-book restoration. I love books of all kinds, and I love my job. It was exciting to know that I could give tired, torn, droopy, bug-bitten books a brand-new life that would allow them to continue to bring enjoyment for hundreds of years to come. It might have sounded boring to some, but in my career so far I had saved dozens of treasured childhood favorites from being thrown away, rescued any number of priceless museum-quality books from being carted off to the used-book store, and even solved a murder or two-or ten-while I was at it. Just in case you thought bookbinding sounded like a yawn-fest, trust me, my life was rarely dull.<br><br> This particular copy of Alice didn't need restoring, though. It was pristine. I wanted it because I had a fascination-okay, call it an obsession-with the iconic Alice and her creator, Lewis Carroll.<br><br> I gazed longingly at the book on display near the front counter of Brothers Bookshop. The store was a book nerd's dream: a cozy, tome-filled haven for people like me who were content to while away an entire day browsing the shelves in hopes of discovering the perfect little gem of a book to sink into.<br><br> The shop carried both new and used books along with all sorts of charming gifts and cards and paper goods. There were comfy chairs in every corner of the store, and a small section along one side was devoted to antiquarian books.<br><br> A magazine section was located at the back of the shop. At the front, a wall of windows looked out onto the neighborhood, and from there I could see my vintage apartment building on the other side of the street.<br><br> Derek Stone and I had decided to walk over here to do a little book browsing on our way next door to shop for vegetables for dinner.<br><br> The bookshop was part of a group of small stores located in a charming three-story Victorian-era building across the street from us. The building, known as the Courtyard, formed a large square, with four shops on each side. Above each shop were two floors with one spacious apartment on each floor. In the interior of the square was a delightful little courtyard overflowing with flowers and trees and several groupings of chairs and small tables. It was the perfect place to enjoy a caffe latte and read a book.<br><br> "Hi, Eddie," I said to the bookshop owner as I inched closer to the display.<br><br> "Hey, Brooklyn," Eddie Cox said without glancing up from his perch at the front counter. He knew it was me. Probably had seen me hovering nearby for the last few minutes. "I suppose you want to get another look at the book."<br><br> "I do," I said. "How did you know?"<br><br> He chuckled. "Just a lucky guess. Might have something to do with the fact that you show up here every other day and beg to see it."<br><br> All too true. But at least so far I hadn't drooled on the glass case. "And here I thought I was being so subtle."<br><br> "Subtle. Right." Still chuckling, he opened the drawer beneath the cash register and pulled out a small set of keys. I had known Eddie Cox and his brother-in-law, Terrence Payton, for almost four years, ever since I'd moved in across the street from Brothers Bookshop. The two men owned the charming shop together, and yes, I was there almost every other day because, you know, books.<br><br> Eddie carefully handed me the Alice, and it was all I could do not to clutch it to my chest in excitement. Instead, I put it down on the counter and ran my finger across the smooth leather cover.<br><br> Eddie raised an eyebrow. "I don't do this for everyone, you know."<br><br> "I know you don't, and I really appreciate you doing it for me. I'll be careful."<br><br> "I know you will." He winked at me. "Otherwise, I wouldn't allow it anywhere near your greedy little hands."<br><br> With a quick laugh, I scanned the store and spied Derek at the end of the middle aisle, where the latest mysteries and thrillers were displayed. He appeared to be involved in one particular book, so I knew I had a few minutes to enjoy the Alice. I opened it slowly, turning as always to the title page, where the publication date was posted: 1866.<br><br> This copy was considered a first edition, but actually it wasn't. The original version of the book had been published the year before, in 1865, but those books had been taken off the market by Lewis Carroll when his illustrator, John Tenniel, stated that the quality of his drawings had been poorly reproduced.<br><br> That earlier, 1865 version was known as the "Suppressed Alice" or the "Sixty-five Alice." All of those books were returned to the publisher except for fifty author copies that Lewis Carroll had kept for himself.<br><br> Eventually, most of those author copies had ended up in others' hands. Very few remained on the market today, and any that did were considered beyond rare. One had been auctioned off recently for almost two million dollars.<br><br> I would probably never get my hands on such a rare treasure as that, but I was perfectly happy with the one I currently held in my hands. This book was as fine as any I'd ever seen.<br><br> "Hello, Brooklyn."<br><br> I turned and saw Eddie's brother-in-law standing nearby. "Terrence. Hello."<br><br> "Is he going to sell you the book this time?" Terrence asked with a twinkle in his eye.<br><br> "I don't know." Glancing at Eddie, I bit back a smile. I knew he wouldn't sell it to me, since I'd tried to buy it a few hundred times before. But no harm in trying again. "What about it, Eddie? Will you sell me this book?"<br><br> "Never," Eddie insisted, as always. Then he added, "It was a gift from a very special friend."<br><br> "Wow." He'd never mentioned that before. I gazed at the book in my hand. "Must be a nice friend."<br><br> "I had a book just like that," Terrence grumbled. "But someone stole it."<br><br> "Are you kidding?" Did I look as confused as I felt? "You had a copy of this same book?"<br><br> Eddie barely suppressed an eye roll. "Terrence always claims that, but where's the proof?"<br><br> "I said it was stolen." Terrence's eyes narrowed in on Eddie, and I suddenly wondered if he suspected his own brother-in-law had taken the book from him.<br><br> Eddie shrugged. "That's why I keep mine locked inside this shatterproof case, right here in plain sight where everyone can see it, which means no one can steal it. I'm no fool."<br><br> "I'm not a fool, either." Terrence huffed, clearly insulted. He turned to me. "I'll have you know, my copy was locked inside the safe in my closet upstairs. Fat lot of good that did me," he added, muttering.<br><br> "You're just not as lucky as I am," Eddie said with a crooked grin as he flexed his biceps. "Or as manly."<br><br> I laughed, but Terrence was not amused. He continued to glower, shaking his head. "You're the fool. I'm as lucky as anyone else. Except when it comes to in-laws."<br><br> They were both ignoring me now. Over the last few years, I'd realized that the two men butted heads more often than not. Family was never easy, but still . . . If you didn't get along with your brother-in-law, why go into business with him?<br><br> The two men were in their forties and fairly nice-looking in different ways. Eddie had a classic runner's physique, tall and slim, with silver hair and a rakish goatee, which suited him. Terrence was a few inches shorter and bulkier, but most of his girth was muscle. He looked as though he might've been a boxer in his youth.<br><br> The two men had married sisters who divorced them within weeks of each other and moved to Florida together. I got the feeling that Eddie and Terrence didn't miss their ex-wives too much. They were both book fanatics who spent all of their time in the bookshop. I'd never known them to take a day off.<br><br> Handing the book back to Eddie, I tried to veer our conversation around to the original subject. "Not that you both don't deserve the very finest things, but who in their right mind would give up such a beautiful book?"<br><br> Eddie wiggled his eyebrows and grinned slyly. "A generous person who recognizes greatness, I suppose."<br><br> It was Terrence's turn to roll his eyes. I started to grin, but something bumped into my ankle and I jolted. Glancing down, I saw Furbie, the bookshop cat, staring up at me with his teeth clenching a stuffed mouse. Stuffed with catnip was my guess, if Furbie's lazy gaze meant anything.<br><br> "Hello, Furbie," I murmured, and reached down to scratch the soft gray fur around his ears. "Aren't you a pretty kitty?"<br><br> In response to the flattery, he dropped the toy at my feet. I picked it up and tossed it a few yards down the nearest aisle, expecting the frisky cat to pounce after it. Instead, he gave me a censorious look, tossed his head imperiously, and sidled awkwardly after the mouse.<br><br> "I think Furbie's drunk," I said.<br><br> "It's Terrence's fault," Eddie claimed. "He's an enabler."<br><br> "You're just jealous," Terrence retorted, "because Furbie likes me best."<br><br> "Of course he does, because you feed him catnip and empower his bad behavior." Eddie turned to me. "I'm the disciplinarian."<br><br> "You're just a meanie," Terrence muttered, and they were off on another squabble-fest, this time over the cat. These two would tangle over anything!<br><br> After letting them go off for a few more seconds, I tried to steer them back to the topic of Terrence's missing book.<br><br> "When did you lose your copy of Alice?" I asked Terrence as Eddie unlocked the glass case and gingerly slipped his Alice back inside.<br><br> "I didn't lose it."<br><br> "Sorry. When was it stolen?"<br><br> Terrence thought for a moment. "I guess it's been about six months."<br><br> In the grand scheme of tragedies, I knew this would come in low on the list. But as a book person, I really felt bad for him. "I'm sorry, Terrence."<br><br> "Yes," he said pointedly, still glaring at Eddie, "so am I."<br><br> Eddie put the key to the case back in the drawer and turned to Terrence. "You should be more careful."<br><br> "Oh, shut up."<br><br> Eddie grinned at me, a silent acknowledgment that he had just won this little argument. Their bickering was usually more good-natured, but this time Terrence looked truly offended, which worried me a little. It seemed like they might have quarreled over the stolen book before.<br><br> Derek approached and placed a short stack of books on the front counter.<br><br> "What have you got there?" I asked.<br><br> "I found a few spy novels I thought my father might enjoy."<br><br> "Oh. That's nice." But my stomach gave a little twist at the mention of his father. Derek's parents were going to be visiting from England for the first time the following week, and I still wasn't ready to meet them.<br><br> Derek and I had been together three years, and the one time I'd traveled to England with him, his parents had been away on an anniversary cruise around the Mediterranean. Now that he and I were getting married, it seemed ridiculous that I'd never met them. But as Derek arranged for their whirlwind trip to San Francisco, I found myself growing more and more uneasy about our first encounter.<br><br> Would they like me? It sounded so neurotic to worry, but these were my future in-laws! Of course I was worried. But still, I was sure they were wonderful, and I knew we would all love one another. They had to be the nicest people in the world because Derek was simply a delightful man. But they were English. I had lived in London for a short while years ago, and I truly loved the people, but there was a reserve to some of them that I didn't always understand. I had been raised in a thoroughly American peace-and-love commune founded by fans of the Grateful Dead, and I still wore Birkenstocks to prove it. My family was boisterous and fun loving. I simply couldn't imagine what Derek's parents would think of me. And Derek, while awesome, could be intimidating to others when he wanted to be. At times it was one of his best attributes. But it made me wonder if his parents might be intimidating as well.</p><h2>Shadowland</h2><p>GREAT OVERALL COPY WITH A FEW CREASES TO THE SPINE AND COVER - STURDY BINDING AND STRONG PAGES.....cst</p><p>First setting: an all-male prep school in Arizona, where two sensitive freshmen form a bond based on their interest in magic tricks.

They had only been in the new house a matter of weeks, but already it had a familiarity about it as if he were returning rather than moving in for the first time. It was many small things: the light on the patch of stone wall at the end of the garden, thte bark of the trees, the smell of grass deep in the shade under the branches.<br><br>It was early evening and there were moths fluttering and drifting in the early May air, which was already cooler as twilight approached. Charlotte was inside somewhere, probably upstairs seeing the children to bed. He hoped she had also thought of supper. He was surprisingly hungry, considering he had done little all day but enjoy the rare full Saturday at home. That was one of the benefits of having been promoted to Superintendent when Micah Drummond had retired: he had more time. The disadvantages were that he carried far more responsibility and found himself, rather too often for his wishes, behind a desk in Bow Street instead of out investigating.<br><br>He settled a little lower in the seat and crossed his legs, smiling without being aware of it. He was dressed in old clothes, suitable for the gardening he had done through the day very casually, now and then.<br><br>There was a click as the French doors opened and closed behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, sir . . .&#x201d;<br><br>It was Gracie, the little waif of a maid they had brought with them, and who was now filled with importance and satisfaction because she had a woman in five days a week to do the heavy scrubbing and the laundry, and a gardener&#x2019;s boy three days. This fell under the heading of a considerable staff. Pitt&#x2019;s promotion had been hers as well, and she was immensely proud of it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Gracie,&#x201d; he said without getting up.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a gentleman to see you, sir, a Mr. Matthew Desmond . . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Desmond?&#x201d; he repeated incredulously.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes sir.&#x201d; She looked startled. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t I &#x2019;ave let &#x2019;im in&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes! Yes, certainly you should. Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the parlor, sir. I offered &#x2019;im a cup o&#x2019; tea but &#x2019;e wouldn&#x2019;t &#x2019;ave it. &#x2019;E looks awful upset, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said absently, brushing past her and striding to the doors. He pulled them open and went into the sitting room. It was now filled with the last sunlight and looking oddly golden, in spire of its green and white furnishings. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he added over his shoulder to Gracie. He went into the hall, his heart beating faster and his mouth suddenly dry with anticipation and something not unlike guilt.<br><br>He hesitated for a moment, a confusion of memories teeming through his mind and stretching as far back as consciousness would take him. He had grown up in the country, on the Desmond estate, where his father had been gamekeeper. He was an only child, as was Sir Arthur&#x2019;s son, a year younger than Pitt. And when Matthew Desmond had longed for someone to play with in the huge and beautiful grounds, Sir Arthur had found it natural enough to choose the gamekeeper&#x2019;s son. It had been an easy friendship from the beginning, and in time extended to the schoolroom as well. Sir Arthur had been pleased enough to include a second child and watch his own son&#x2019;s application improve, with someone to share his lessons and to compete against him.<br><br>Even with Pitt&#x2019;s fathers disgrace when he was unjustly accused of poaching (not on Sir Arthur&#x2019;s lands, but those of his nearest neighbor), the family were permitted to remain on the estate, with rooms in the servants&#x2019; quarters, and Pitt himself had not been denied his continued education while his mother worked in the kitchens.<br><br>But it had been fifteen years now since Pitt had been back, and at least ten since he had had any contact with Sir Arthur or Matthew. As he stood in the hallway with his hand on the doorknob, it was not only guilt that stirred in his mind but a sense of foreboding.<br><br>He opened the door and went in.<br><br>Matthew turned from the mantelshelf, which he had been standing near. He had changed little: he was still tall, lean, almost narrow, with a long, erratic, humorous face, although all the laughter was bleached out of him now and he looked haggard and intensely serious.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Thomas,&#x201d; he said quietly, coming forward and offering his hand.<br><br>Pitt took it and held it firmly, searching Matthew&#x2019;s face. The signs of grief were so obvious it would have been offensive and ridiculous to pretend he had not seen them.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked, sickeningly sure he already knew.<br><br>&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; Matthew said simply. &#x201c;He died yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt was completely unprepared for the sense of loss which swept over him. He had not seen Arthur Desmond since before he had married and had children. He had only written letters to mark these events. Now he felt a loneliness, almost as if his roots had been torn away. A past he had taken for granted was suddenly no longer there. He had kept meaning to return. At first it had been a matter of pride which had kept him away. He would go back when he could show them all that the gamekeeper&#x2019;s son had achieved success, honor. Of course it had taken far longer than in his innocence he had supposed. As the years passed it had become harder, the distance too difficult to bridge. Now, without warning, it had become impossible.<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said to Matthew.<br><br>Matthew tried to smile, at least in acknowledgment, but it was a poor effort. His face still looked haunted. <br>&#x201c;Thank you for coming to tell me,&#x201d; Pitt went on. &#x201c;That was . . . very good of you.&#x201d; It was also far more than he deserved, and he knew it in a flush of shame.<br><br>Matthew dismissed it almost impatiently with a wave of his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;He . . .&#x201d; He swallowed and took a deep breath, his eyes on Pitt&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;He died at his club, here in London.&#x201d;<br>Pitt was going to say he was sorry again, but it was pointless, and he ended by saying nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Of an overdose of laudanum,&#x201d; Matthew went on. His eyes searched Pitt&#x2019;s face, seeking understanding, assurance of some answer to pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Laudanum?&#x201d; Pitt repeated it to ascertain he had heard correctly. &#x201c;Was . . . was he ill? Suffering from&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Matthew cut him off. &#x201c;No, he was not ill. He was seventy, but he was in good health and good spirits. There was nothing wrong with him at all.&#x201d; He looked angry as he said it and there was a fierce defensiveness in his voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Then why was he taking laudanum?&#x201d; Pitt&#x2019;s policeman&#x2019;s mind pursued the details and the logic of it in spite of his emotions, or Matthew&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Matthew said desperately. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point!&#x201d; They are saying he was old and losing his wits, and that he took an overdoes because he no longer knew what he was doing.&#x201d; His eyes were blazing and he was poised ready to fly at Pitt if he even suspected him of agreeing.<br><br>Pitt remembered Arthur Desmond as he had known him: tall, ineffably elegant in the casual way of those who have both confidence and a natural grace, and yet at the same time almost always untidy. His clothes did not match each other. Even with a valet&#x2019;s best attention, he managed to select something other than whatever was put out for him. Yet such was his innate dignity, and the humor in his long, clever face, that no one even noticed, much less thought to criticize. He had been highly individual, at times eccentric, but always with such a basic sanity, and tolerance of human frailty, that he should have been the last man on earth to resort to laudanum at all. But if he had, then he was quite capable of absentmindedly dosing himself twice.<br><br>Except that surely once would have sent him to sleep anyway?<br><br>Pitt had vague memories of Sir Arthur&#x2019;s having long wakeful spells even thirty years ago, when Pitt had stayed overnight in the hall as a child. Then Sir Arthur had simply got up and wandered around the library until he found a book he fancied, and sat in one of the old leather chairs and gone to sleep with it open in his lap.<br><br>Matthew was waiting, staring at Pitt with mounting anger.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is saying this?&#x201d; Pitt asked.<br><br>Matthew was taken aback. It was not the question he was expecting.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh&#x2013;the doctor, the men at the club . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What club?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh&#x2013;I am not being very clear, am I? He died at the Morton Club, in the late afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the afternoon? Not at night at all?&#x201d; Pitt was genuinely surprised; he did not have to affect it.<br><br>&#x201c;No! That&#x2019;s the point, Thomas,&#x201d; Matthew said impatiently. &#x201c;They are saying he was demented, suffering from a sort of senile decay. It&#x2019;s not true, not even remotely! Father was one of the sanest men alive. And he didn&#x2019;t drink brandy either! At least, hardly ever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What has brandy to do with it?&#x201d;</p><h2>Animal Hide-And-Seek (Touchy Feely Flap Book)</h2><p>While one cow, two pigs, three sheep, and increasing numbers of other animals can be found in their usual spots on the farm, one of each kind of farm animal is hiding behind the flaps.</p><p>&#39;What a lovely book!

His follow up, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, captivated both fans and critics alike. <i>The Fountain</i> is a Warner Bros. Pictures and Regency Enterprises film. It will be released domestically by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.When his plans for the ambitious, millennia--spanning fantasy film <i>The Fountain </i>were derailed, <i>Pi</i> and <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> director<i></i>Aronofsky recast the story as a graphic novel, and although the movie was subsequently revived (starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz; it's due out later this year), the comics version stayed on track. Its three parallel stories, set in sixteenth-century Central America, the present day, and the distant future, respectively, depict the same man as a conquistador, a scientist, and an interplanetary explorer, always trying to prevent the death of the woman he desperately loves. Aronofsky's epic boldly blends mysticism and science, which coalesce in the hero's discovery of the mythical Tree of Life. Williams' lush, painted artwork, stylistically and narratologically reminiscent of <i>Sandman </i>illustrator Dave McKean's work, perfectly matches the script's passion and challenging abstruseness. Not simply an adaptation of the movie--the screenplay that is its basis being significantly altered when the film project was revived--the lavish, oversize graphic novel ought to be fascinating to compare with the released movie. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Books are the lifeblood of humankind. With this in mind some 85 years ago, Holbrook Jackson, a highly respected man of letters, published in a limited edition a book called The Anatomy of Bibliomania. The current edition, now titled The Book About Books, was welcomed by book collectors and book lovers everywhere because the original was long out of print. The Book About Books is written in the style of the seventeenth-century prose master, Robert Burton, whose prototype The Anatomy of Melancholy served as the spark for this project. This monumental work shows an erudition in its field comparable to Burton, as well as the same racy and witty style of the earlier work. However, Jackson, in his love for and knowledge of books, emerges a distinct personality as he writes of every conceivable topic in the world of bibliomania, from the most learned to the most frivolous. This is the most ambitious and important work of Holbrook Jackson&#39;s many books - a sterling reference and literature book.</p><p>A British "bookman," Jackson (1874-1948) here offers historical and cultural paeans to the book and to reading. The love of books is something nearly universal, though books have been reviled by certain cultures. Mostly, Jackson was a book nut who shared his love for the printed word, which, of course, includes libraries. These volumes were originally published in 1950, 1932, and 1947, respectively.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.&#34;Mr. Jackson&#39;s cross-lights and unexpected illuminations are fascinating... among all his good things from other writers, his own good things should not be overlooked.&#34; -- Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Starting Out: The Essential Guide to Cooking on Your Own</h2><p><p> The survival guide for first-time cooks, with 250 super-simple recipes. </p><p> Designed to help new cooks find independence, <i>Starting Out</i> is filled with crucial tips, basic cooking techniques, and guidelines for stocking cupboards and refrigerator with staples.

Unless you had a parent or grandparent or good friend who taught you how (squeezing cookie dough out of a tube doesn't count), or took an interest in it yourself, you likely have become skilled at opening packages and reheating things in the microwave. Or perhaps most of your meals are prepared by the good folks at McDonald's. If this sounds familiar, sooner or later you should probably learn how to cook. Let's face it, you have to eat. Learning a few cooking skills will make life easier. It will also save you money, benefit your health, and come in handy if you're ever asked to bring something to a party. You may even become responsible for feeding someone else properly. Besides, man cannot live on toast and cereal alone, although many have made a valiant effort. </p><p> It took me a while to understand the saying "you are what you eat"--it applies not solely in terms of health, as in if you eat junk you'll feel like junk--but culturally, emotionally, and socially. We eat for so many reasons other than to satisfy ourselves nutritionally--food is a source of great comfort, to ourselves and each other, and is an inextricable element of any celebration or social event, whether it be a special gathering of friends or just your family (or even yourself) at the dinner table on a regular night. Few and far between are those who solely eat to live. </p><p> You don't have to <i>be</i> a cook to be <i>able</i> to cook. Most people who are convinced of their ineptitude in the kitchen are held back largely by intimidation. The best way to get past this is by doing it--fixing yourself something to eat on a regular basis is really the only way to become comfortable in the kitchen. Try something new, trust your instincts, even if you think you don't have any-and don't be afraid to experiment. Competence leads to confidence, and vice versa. And remember, even the best chefs have kitchen disasters. </p><p> The recipes that follow are meant to act more as guides, to encourage culinary independence rather than instruct how to follow a recipe. Start with the best ingredients you can find or afford, and you're halfway there. If you're not sure of something, look it up, call someone who knows, or taste your way through it. Food is one of life's greatest pleasures--cooking it can be, too. Just Do It. </p></p><h2>Striking Back (Striking Back The Trigeminal Neuralgia and Face Pain Handbook 2004)</h2><p>Published by TNA in 2004 and authored by George Weigel and Kenneth F.

She draws on personal materials, history, research, and literature to create a document of universal importance.</p><p>&#39;In order for all women to have real choices all along the line, &#39; Ardrienne Rich writes, &#39;we need fully to understand the power and powerlessness embodied in motherhood in patriarchal culture.&#39;Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, <strong>Adrienne Rich</strong> (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include <em>The Dream of a Common Language</em>, <em>A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far</em>, <em>An Atlas of the Difficult World</em>, <em>The School Among the Ruins</em>, and <em>Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth</em>.

Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, newly employeds--all will glean shiny pearls of wisdom about the big, bountiful future. The incomparable Dr. Seuss rejoices in the potential everyone has to fulfill their wildest dreams: "You'll be on your way up! / You'll be seeing great sights! / You'll join the high fliers / who soar to high heights." At the same time, he won't delude the starry-eyed upstart about the pitfalls of life: "You can get all hung up / in a prickle-ly perch. / And your gang will fly on. / You'll be left in a Lurch."<p> But fear not! Dr. Seuss, with his inimitable illustrations and exhilarating rhymes, is convinced ("98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed") that success is imminent. As long as you remember "to be dexterous and deft.

Are nation-states being transformed by globalization into a single globalized economy? Do global cultural forces herald a postnational millennium? Tying ethnography to structural analysis, <i>Flexible Citizenship</i> explores such questions with a focus on the links between the cultural logics of human action and on economic and political processes within the Asia-Pacific, including the impact of these forces on women and family life.<br>Explaining how intensified travel, communications, and mass media have created a transnational Chinese public, Aihwa Ong argues that previous studies have mistakenly viewed transnationality as necessarily detrimental to the nation-state and have ignored individual agency in the large-scale flow of people, images, and cultural forces across borders. She describes how political upheavals and global markets have induced Asian investors, in particular, to blend strategies of migration and of capital accumulation and how these transnational subjects have come to symbolize both the fluidity of capital and the tension between national and personal identities. Refuting claims about the end of the nation-state and about &#x201c;the clash of civilizations,&#x201d; Ong presents a clear account of the cultural logics of globalization and an incisive contribution to the anthropology of Asia-Pacific modernity and its links to global social change. <br>This pioneering investigation of transnational cultural forms will appeal to those in anthropology, globalization studies, postcolonial studies, history, Asian studies, Marxist theory, and cultural studies. <p></p><p><br></p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Flexible Citizenship&#34; exemplifies the anthropological imagination at its best. In it Ong offers an analysis of states and citizenship regimes in Asia that is remarkable in its theoretical and empirical breadth.

In the early years of my academic career, Richard Muller's dictionary was the very first to attain such esteemed status. Not only is it a repository of information impossible to find so quickly anywhere else, it is just a darn good read. It's a primer of Latin syntax and at the same time a sophisticated introduction to careful theology. It's a thrill to see it newly improved, some thirty years later! Serious students of Latin, serious students of theology, and--frankly--serious students of clear thought will be in Richard's debt for another generation to come. Well done!"<br>--<b>John&nbsp;L. Thompson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"If one of the most well-read theologians of his generation presents a dictionary, one has high expectations, and Richard Muller does not disappoint! Besides more common terms, one also finds here lucid explanations of rarer scholastic expressions, so that even the specialist will learn and profit from this book. This is a must-have for students and professors and for everybody who studies the Christian tradition."<br>--<b>Ulrich&nbsp;L. Lehner</b>, Marquette University<br><br>"Few theological resources offer as much insight and useful information as Muller's dictionary. I regularly encourage my students to buy this book and read it cover to cover!

But they appear to be getting as much attitude as education, as they start correcting Blanche's English and acting snotty about homeless people. When Blanche and the kids are invited to Amber Cove, an exclusive, all-black resort in Maine, she sees it as the perfect opportunity to observe her children with their wealthy friends and try to figure out how to stop them from becoming people she doesn't want to know.<br>Along the way, Blanche gets an insider's view of the color and class divisions within the black community. Blanche stands out against the light-skinned, college-educated residents at Amber Cove, and some of the guests make sure she knows it - including her own daughter. But when one of the guests has a fatal accident and the godson of a famous septuagenarian feminist commits suicide, Blanche is enlisted to find out if these events are connected. What she discovers is a web of secrets that somebody may be willing to kill for, even as she meets a man determined to sweep her off her feet, no matter how much she weighs.</p><p>Segregation is alive and well at Maine's exclusive Amber Cove seaside resort. But it's segregation between the Insiders--light- skinned African-American professionals like pioneering feminist Mattie Harris, her godson Hank (an MIT history professor), and the nervously proper Tatterson family--and the Outsiders, dark-skinned upstarts like Tina Jackson, the dreadlocked beauty involved with Durant Tatterson, and Blanche White, the caustic domestic who, relocated from North Carolina to Boston, thinks she is taking a vacation from detective work (Blanche on the Lam, 1992). No such luck: Not only was bullying Insider gossip Faith Brown electrocuted in her bathtub the night before Blanche arrived, but Hank has vanished into the Atlantic, leaving behind a note admitting that he killed her. So where's the mystery? In Faith's purse, where Blanche, goaded by an intruder who unwisely thought to discourage her, finds a cache of papers whose nasty secrets make it clear that Faith was a lot more vicious than she looked--and that certain Insiders are protecting much more than their social standing. Even so, tracking down the victims of Faith's treachery makes for a pretty limp mystery that, as in Blanche's debut, takes a back seat to an acerbic portrait of class infighting at its most corrosive. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In her second novel, Neely addresses the issue of color-based bigotry within the black community. As a child, Blanche White was taunted by her black classmates as "Tar Baby," and so she sets out less than enthusiastically for Amber Cove, a posh Maine resort filled with light-skinned blacks. The trip will get her out of Boston, however ("the most racist city in which she'd ever lived"), and give her a chance to see if her niece and nephew, who are spending the summer there, are picking up "hincty ideas" from what her friend Ardell calls "Caucasian-ettes." Despite an initially frosty reception at Amber Cove Inn, Blanche quickly makes friends with Mattie Harris, an "arrogant old girl"; catches the eye of Robert Stuart, a handsome pharmacist from the nearby town; and picks up the latest news--that Faith Brown, who routinely dug up and revealed dirt on others, was accidentally electrocuted while bathing. When a cove resident commits suicide, leaving behind a note implicating himself in Faith's death, Mattie decides that she and Blanche must get to the bottom of things. Blanche continues to appeal in her so-what-if-I've-got-an-attitude way, but while her first outing, Blanche on the Lam , was a mystery with a bit of message, this one is a message with a bit of mystery. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Candy Bomber: The Story of the Berlin Airlift&#39;s &#34;Chocolate Pilot&#34;</h2><p>After World War II the United States and Britain airlifted food and supplies into Russian-blockaded West Berlin.

What started as a single pilot's car tour of bombed-out Berlin turned into an international campaign to help lighten the suffering of the children of West Berlin. The time was 1948, and the Soviet Union had closed all land access to the isolated Free World sectors of West Berlin in an attempt to starve the people into accepting Communist rule. On an impulse, a C-54 cargo pilot, Lt. Gail S. Halvorsen, shared the only two sticks of gum he had with a group of about 30 children. What started as a somewhat clandestine candy-dropping operation by Halvorsen and his buddies eventually became a USAF-sanctioned operation. As the airlift of food and fuel continued for almost two years, tons of candy were dropped (using tiny parachutes) for the children who waited in the flight path below. The text is liberally illustrated with black-and-white photos, copies of letters, and a diagram of how the flight patterns worked. Endpapers contain color reproductions of a few of the many pieces of children's artwork that Halvorsen received as the Chocolate Pilot, Uncle Wiggly Wings, and Dear Onkl of the Heaven. Vocabulary is relatively easy, but adequate for the topic, which makes the text flow easily. The book concludes with extensive biographical, historical, and author's notes. This is a real treat a World War II title with a happy ending.

McKinty lives in Seattle, Washington, with his wife and two children.*Starred Review* A headless torso found in a suitcase presents just the kind of case Detective Inspector Sean Duffy of the Royal Ulster Constabulary wants to pursue, even after he&#x2019;s ordered to let it go. When the victim is identified as an American poisoned with a rare plant, and the suitcase is found to have belonged to Martin McAlpine&#x2014;an army reservist and brother of a baronet killed months earlier, presumably by the IRA&#x2014;the case becomes even more interesting, especially after the detective who did a perfunctory investigation of McAlpine&#x2019;s murder reopens that case and is himself murdered. It&#x2019;s 1982, when violence in Northern Ireland threatens to escalate after Britain&#x2019;s invasion of the Falkland Islands pulls away troops that support the RUC. In this pitch-perfect sequel to The Cold Cold Ground (2012), the second in the author&#x2019;s Troubles Trilogy, Duffy is nearly overwhelmed by politics. This is crime fiction at its best: a police procedural with dialogue that&#x2019;s crisp and occasionally lighthearted; blistering action that&#x2019;s often lethal; McKinty&#x2019;s mordant Belfastian wit; and a protagonist readers won&#x2019;t want to leave behind when the trilogy ends. --Michele Leber</p><h2>Bungalow Colors: Exteriors</h2><p>Bungalow Colors: Exteriors addresses the importance of color in Arts&amp; Crafts architecture.

First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it&#39;s the unsolved case of a missing eight-year-old girl, already decades-old, that Reacher can&#39;t let go. The Duncans want Reacher gone - or dead.

It is nothing short of remarkable that Child is not only able to continually reinvent his ex-military cop, but that each installment is better than the last. <em>Worth Dying For</em> finds our battered hero hiding in plain sight in a tiny Nebraska town, trying to recover from the catastrophe he left behind in South Dakota (no spoilers here, but readers are still arguing over <em>61 Hours</em>&#x2019;s cliffhanger ending). Fans rarely see such a physically vulnerable Reacher (in the first part of the book he is barely able to lift his arms) but it just adds to the fist-pumping satisfaction of seeing our weary good guy take on the small-town baddies. --<em>Daphne Durham</em><b>Lee Child</b> is the author of fifteen Jack Reacher thrillers, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers<i> Persuader, The Enemy, One Shot,</i> and <i>The Hard Way,</i> and the #1 bestsellers 6<i>1 Hours, Gone Tomorrow, Bad Luck and Trouble,</i> and <i>Nothing to Lose</i>.

More than one person at Latter End found themselves stretched to the limit by Lois and her bullying, and it was only a matter of time before somebody snapped. It was unthinkable of course ...but if anyone ever murdered Lois Latter, it would be very embarrassing to discover just how many people might have wished her dead.</p><p>Patricia Wentworth (1878&#x2013;1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteriesPatricia Wentworth wrote over seventy novels, but none more popular than her Miss Maud Silver series. In this one, Miss Silver, the owner of a private detective agency, is called upon to look into the attempted poisonings of Lois Latter, a selfish, bullying woman with many enemies. When Lois is actually murdered, everyone, including her husband, his extended family, and the household staff, is suspect. Diana Bishops voice captures the coolly professional Miss Silver as she knits her way through the investigation and unravels the complex motives of all involved. Bishop does creditable renderings of all the characters, especially Miss Silvers sometimes colleagues, Chief Constable Randal March and Chief Investigator Ernest Lamb. Her performance makes Wentworths cozy whodunit a worthwhile listen.

These pictures of everyday people still speak to us today, 40 years and several generations later.</p><p>Armed with a camera and a fresh cache of film and bankrolled by a Guggenheim Foundation grant, Robert Frank crisscrossed the United States during 1955 and 1956. The photographs he brought back form a portrait of the country at the time and hint at its future. He saw the hope of the future in the faces of a couple at city hall in Reno, Nevada, and the despair of the present in a grimy roofscape. He saw the roiling racial tension, glamour, and beauty, and, perhaps because Frank himself was on the road, he was particularly attuned to Americans' love for cars. Funeral-goers lean against a shiny sedan, lovers kiss on a beach blanket in front of their parked car, young boys perch in the back seat at a drive-in movie. A sports car under a drop cloth is framed by two California palm trees; on the next page, a blanket is draped over a car accident victim's body in Arizona.<p> Robert Frank's Americans reappear 40 years after they were initially published in this exquisite volume by Scalo. Each photograph (there are more than 80 of them) stands alone on a page, while the caption information is included at the back of the book, allowing viewers an unfettered look at the images. Jack Kerouac's original introduction, commissioned when the photographer showed the writer his work while sitting on a sidewalk one night outside of a party, provides the only accompanying text. Kerouac's words add narrative dimension to Frank's imagery while in turn the photographs themselves perfectly illustrate the writer's own work.</p><b> Select Praise for the 50th Anniversary Edition of Robert Frank, <i>The Americans</i>:</b> <br><br> "Photography was never the same after <i> The Americans</i>. Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Nan Goldin all walked through the door Frank opened. And his influence was by no means limited to art photography. Fashion ads, music videos, movies- everyone stole from Frank". <br> <b> Malcolm Jones, <i> Newsweek</i> </b> <br> <br> "One of the greatest photography books of the 20th century." <br> <b> Richard Lacayo, <i> TIME</i> </b> <br><br> "Frank's genius was to see America unfiltered, much like Walker Evans and Dorthea Lange. There are no tricks here, no posing or false glory, just a sense of desolation." <br> <b> David Ulin, <i> Los Angeles Times</i> </b> <br><br> <i> "The Americans </i> reflects the mood of a turbulent decade, when postwar euphoria was giving way to racial tension and anti-Communist paranoia. But it's not just remarkable for its subject matter. The book offered a new visual language for photography: an intimate, off kilter aesthetic that's been imitated so many times that it seems obvious. In 1958, in an era of Tupperware and Hula-Hoops, it was far from obvious. Like its contemporary Beat-era poetry and novels, <i> The Americans </i> was a blast of authenticity, a potent artistic statement, a revelation." <br> <b> Sarah Coleman, <i> Planet</i></b> <br><br> "To mark the book's fiftieth anniversary, Steidl has published a new edition, complete with Kerouac's introduction, making <i> The Americans </i> the most famous photography book all over again." <br> <b> Nicole Rudick, <i> Bookforum </i></b></p><h2>Crossing the Wire</h2><p><p><strong>In this riveting, action-packed novel from award-winning author Will Hobbs, a teenage boy hoping to help his loved ones must fight for his life as he makes the dangerous journey across the Mexican border into the United States.</strong></p><p>When falling crop prices threaten his family with starvation, fifteen-year-old Victor Flores heads north in an attempt to "cross the wire" from Mexico into America so he can find work and help ease the finances at home.</p><p>But with no coyote money to pay the smugglers who sneak illegal workers across the border, Victor struggles to survive as he jumps trains, stows away on trucks, and hikes grueling miles through the Arizona desert.</p><p>Victor's passage is fraught with freezing cold, scorching heat, hunger, and dead ends.

A THICK BOOK WITH GOLD GILT PAGES AND LETTERING. MANY,MANY STORIES FOR CHILDREN TO READ. A BEAUTIFUL EDITION</p><p></p><h2>Herman Melville: A Biography (Volume 2, 1851-1891)</h2><p><p>The first volume of Hershel Parker's definitive biography of Herman Melville&#x2015;a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize&#x2015;closed on a mid-November day in 1851. In the dining room of the Little Red Inn in Lenox, Massachusetts, Melville had just presented an inscribed copy of his new novel, <i>Moby-Dick</i>, to his intimate friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, the man to whom the work was dedicated. "Take it all in all," Parker concluded, "this was the happiest day of Melville's life."</p><p> <i>Herman Melville: A Biography, Volume 2, 1851-1891</i> chronicles Melville's life in rich detail, from this ecstatic moment to his death, in obscurity, forty years later. Parker describes the malignity of reviewers and sheer bad luck that doomed <i>Moby-Dick</i> to failure (and its author to prolonged indebtedness), the savage reviews he received for his next book <i>Pierre</i>, and his inability to have the novel <i>The Isle of the Cross</i>&#x2015;now lost&#x2015;published at all. Melville turned to magazine fiction, writing the now-classic "Bartleby" and "Benito Cereno," and produced a final novel, <i>The Confidence Man</i>, a mordant satire of American optimism. Over his last three decades, while working as a customs inspector in Manhattan, Melville painstakingly remade himself as a poet, crafting the centennial epic <i>Clarel</i>, in which he sorted out his complex feelings for Hawthorne, and the masterful story "Billy Budd," originally written as a prose headnote to an unfinished poem.</p><p>Through prodigious archival research into hundreds of family letters and diary entries, newly discovered newspaper articles, and marginalia from books that Melville owned, Parker vividly recreates the last four decades of Melville's life, episode after episode unknown to previous biographers. The concluding volume of <i>Herman Melville: A Biography</i> confirms Hershel Parker's position as the world's leading Melville scholar, demonstrating his unrivaled biographical, literary, and historical imagination and providing a rich new portrait of a great&#x2015;and profoundly American&#x2015;artist.</p></p><p><p>The definitive life of the great American writer concludes, chronicling Melville's achievement and courage after the critical and commercial failure of <i>Moby-Dick</i>.</p> (2003)"An awesome achievement, indispensable for all serious Melvillians, with the vividness of a great Victorian novel and the precision of the finest historical scholarship."&#x2014;Robert Faggen, Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>Cesar&#39;s Rules: Your Way to Train a Well-Behaved Dog</h2><p><b>The training book you&#x2019;ve been waiting for from the bestselling author and star of National Geographic Channel&#x2019;s <i>Dog Whisperer</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Your dog just doesn&#x2019;t seem to <i>listen</i>.

This is his first book.Books such as The Greatest Generation have eloquently argued that the men and women who survived World War II played a crucial role in determining America&#x2019;s national culture; to some extent, Bachner agrees with this thesis. "Our current image of American masculinity was formed at that particular moment in time," he writes in the introduction to this moving book of duotone photos. But the image that was passed down most often suggested that Real Men were loners, rugged individuals who relied on no one. According to Bachner, however, the photographic record "flatly contradicts that notion." During his six years of research in the Still Pictures Branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, he unearthed a trove of Navy photos that "display a tender regard and closeness among men largely alien to our contemporary culture." Most of these images were taken by the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, which was commanded by the famous photographer Edward J. Steichen for most of WWII. Many have never been published. Why were these servicemen able to form such affectionate friendships? In answer, Bachner quotes John D&#x2019;Emilio: "Living in close quarters, not knowing whether they would make it through the war, and depending on one another for survival, men of whatever sexual persuasion formed intense emotional attachments." Whatever the reason, these gorgeously composed, evocative images suggest that men then, as now, could let down the John Wayne stance to share a cigarette, laugh over a joke and do a little roughhousing.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It came upon him at eight o&#x2019;clock on this morning of October twenty-third; he responded, he yielded, he climbed over the snake fence at the boundary of his sweet potato field and went away among the pines.</p><p>Ira Claffey had employed no overseer since the first year of the war, and had risen early this morning to direct his hands in the potato patch. Nowadays there were only seven and one-half hands on the place, house and field, out of a total Negro population of twelve souls; the other four were an infant at the breast and three capering children of shirt-tail size.</p><p>Jem and Coffee he ordered to the digging, and made certain that they were thorough in turning up the harvest and yet gentle in lifting the potatoes. Nothing annoyed Ira Claffey like storing a good thirty-five bushels in a single mound and then losing half of them through speedy decay.</p><p>In such a manner, he thought, have some of our best elements and institutions perished. One bruise, one carelessness, and rot begins. Decay is a secret but hastening act in darkness; then one opens up the pine bark and pine straw&#x2014;or shall we say, the Senate?&#x2014;and observes a visible wastage and smell, a wet and horrid mouldering of the potatoes. Or shall we say, of the men?</p><p>In pursuit of his own husbandry on this day, Ira carried a budding knife in his belt. While musing in bed the night before, he had been touched with ambition: he would bud a George the Fourth peach upon a Duane&#x2019;s Purple plum.</p><p>Veronica was not yet asleep, but reading her Bible by candlelight beside him. He told her about it.</p><p>But, Ira, does not the Duane&#x2019;s Purple ripen too soon? Aren&#x2019;t those the trees just on the other side of the magnolias?</p><p>No, no, my dear. Those are Prince&#x2019;s Yellow Gage. The Duane&#x2019;s Purple matures in keeping with the George Fourths. I&#x2019;d warrant you about the second week of July. Say about the tenth. I should love to see that skin. Such a fine red cheek on the George Fourths, and maybe dotted with that lilac bloom and yellow specks&#x2014;</p><p>But she was not hearing him, she was weeping. He turned to watch her; he sighed, he put out one big hand and touched the thick gray-yellow braid which weighted on her white-frilled shoulder. It was either Moses or Sutherland whom she considered now. Dully he wondered which one.</p><p>She said, on receiving the communication of his thought, though he had said nothing&#x2014; She spoke Suthy&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Oh, said Ira. I said nothing to make you think&#x2014;</p><p>The Prince&#x2019;s Yellow Gage. He fancied them so. When they were still green he&#x2019;d hide them in the little waist he wore. Many&#x2019;s the time I gave him a belting&#x2014;</p><p>She sobbed a while longer, and he stared into the gloom beyond the bed curtains, and did his best to forget Suthy. Suthy was the eldest. Sixteenth Georgia. It was away up at the North, at a place no one had ever heard of before, a place called Gettysburg.</p><p>In recent awareness of bereavement had lain the germ of retreat and restlessness, perhaps; but sometimes Ira spirited himself off into the woods when he was fleeing from no sadness or perplexity. He had gone like that since he could first remember. Oh, pines were taller forty-five years ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when he was only three feet tall, the easy nodding grace of their foliage was reared out of all proportion, thirty times his stature. And forests were wilder, forty-five years ago, over in Liberty County, and he went armed with a wooden gun which old Jehu had carved and painted as a Christmas gift for him. It had a real lock, a real flint; it snapped and the sparks flew. Ira Claffey slew brigades of redcoats with this weapon; he went as commander of a force of small blacks; he was their general.</p><p>Hi, them&#x2019;s British, Mastah Iry.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Yonder in them &#x2019;simmons!</p><p>Take them on the flank.</p><p>Hi, what you say we do, Mastah?</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what he wanted them to do. Something about the flank. His Uncle Sutherland talked about a flank attack in some wild distant spot known as the Carolinas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course this was later on, perhaps only forty years ago, when Ira Claffey was ten.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Charge those redcoats! They advanced upon the persimmon brake in full cry and leaping; and once there came terror when a doe soared out of the thicket directly in their faces, and all the little darkies scattered like quail, and Ira came near to legging it after them.</p><p>In similar shades he had been Francis Marion, and surely his own boys had scuttled here in identical pursuits. It was a good place to be, treading alone on the clay-paved path curving its way to the closest branch of Sweetwater Creek. God walked ahead and behind and with him, near, powerful, silent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.</i></p><p>He had budded the peach upon the plum as he wished to do, though he feared that it was a trifle too late in the season for success. He budded each of the two selected trees five times, and then went back to the potato field. Coffee and Jem were doing well enough, but they were plagu�d slow; Ira had been emphatic about the tenderness he required of them, and they handled the big sulphur-colored Brimstones as if they were eggs. Well, he thought, I shan&#x2019;t speed them on this. Better forty bushels well-dug and well-stored than eighty bushels bumped and scratched and ready to spoil as soon as they&#x2019;re covered.</p><p>Keep on with it until I return, and mind about no bruising. I shall look up some pine straw&#x2014;where it&#x2019;s thickest and easy to scoop&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ll fetch the cart after the nooning.</p><p>Yassah.</p><p>Frost had not yet killed the vines. Some planters always waited for a killing frost before they dug, but Ira was certain that the crop kept better if dug immediately before the frost struck.</p><p>He was newly come into his fifty-first year; the natal day had been observed on October sixth. Black Naomi chuckled mysteriously in the kitchen; there had been much talk about, Mistess, can I please speak with you a minute <i>alone</i>? He had to pretend that he was blind and deaf, and owned no suspicion that delicate and hard-to-come-by substances were being lavished in his honor. The fragrant Lady Baltimore cake appeared in time, borne by Ira Claffey&#x2019;s daughter because she would not trust the wenches with this treasure.</p><p>There they sat, the three surviving Claffeys left at home, sipping their roast-grain coffee and speaking words in praise of the cake, and now Ira had lived for half a century&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty years stuffed with woe and work and dreams and peril. He sought to dwell in recollection only on the benefits accruing. With Veronica and Lucy he tried to keep his imaginings away from far-off roads where horses and men were in tragic operation.</p><p>The best I&#x2019;ve tasted since the Mexican War.</p><p>Poppy, you always say that. About everything.</p><p>Come, come, Lucy. Do I indeed?</p><p>You do, agreed his wife, and gave him her wan smile above the home-dipped candles.</p><p>Yes, sir, chimed in Lucy. It&#x2019;s always the best and the worst and the biggest and all such things, but always dated from that old war.</p><p>After this night, said Ira, I presume that I should date everything from my fiftieth birthday?</p><p>Poppy, love, you don&#x2019;t look even on the outskirts of fifty. Scarcely a shred of gray in your hair.</p><p>Well, my dear, I don&#x2019;t have much hair left to me.</p><p>That&#x2019;s no certain indication of encroaching age. Is it, Mother? Take Colonel Tollis. I declare, he can&#x2019;t be aged over thirty-one or two, and yet he&#x2019;s got less hair than&#x2014;</p><p>Lucy. Do you consider it ladylike, to discuss baldness so&#x2014;so intimately?</p><p>Well, I declare&#x2014;</p><p>So it had gone; they uttered their little jests and remonstrances; they had their affection; the stringy candles sank and died in chipped gilt candelabra, and in the end Ira Claffey sat alone in his library and treated himself to port. He had tasted no port since the previous winter (there was so little of it left now) and he made a silent gesture and toasted each of his sons in turn as they stared from ambrotype frames beside him. His hand went down and rubbed along his right leg; it caressed his shabby fawn-colored pantaloons above the knotted hole which for years he had bandaged afresh each day. I&#x2019;d be with you, fifty or no fifty, he tried to tell his sons, reaching to them across uncharted distances and dimensions. I&#x2019;d be among the muskets if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Monterey. I wonder who that Mexican was! I wonder if he is living still&#x2014;sorrowing as I am sorrowing, going through repeated and sometimes doleful mimicry. Still able to love, however? Not so frequently? But still able, and most eager at times.</p><p>The wine affected Ira Claffey because he drank so little of it in this time of strife and paucity. He thought of Veronica and the fever which came over him sometimes in darkness, the drawing up of her nightdress, the muffled hysteria of their encounter, the shame which she always admitted afterward because she had been taught that carnal enjoyment was lewd and Ira could never persuade her otherwise. He thought of the mistress he had had in Milledgeville when he was in the Legislature, he thought of pretty strumpets he&#x2019;d known in the brief time when he was a soldier, he thought of the first brown girl he ever lay with at seventeen or thereabouts in age.</p><p>How do you countenance such goings-on? You, professedly a religious man&#x2014;</p><p>I suppose each of us must be guilty of certain sins. We&#x2019;d be less than human if we weren&#x2019;t blemished a bit. And I strive earnestly not to envy, not to grow little snips and slips and buds and seeds of jealousy. I deplore cruelty, and own no avarice&#x2014;at least none I&#x2019;m conscious of. But lust&#x2014;</p><p>I&#x2019;m steeped in that particular brand of iniquity. At least&#x2014;when I was younger&#x2014; And now, now, tonight, the night I&#x2019;m fifty&#x2014;</p><p>Silently he opened the library door and looked across the dark hall. Lucy and her mother were scraping lint at the big table in the crowded parlor; they had a servant helping them, but Lucy was yawning. He felt a fire as he saw that yawn. Soon, then&#x2014; To bed, to bed! Incestuous sheets, sweet prince? Nay, my Veronica and I lie within the embrace of a mortal primness known as Holy Wedlock.</p><p>Thus we contrived eight children, and thus the four small graves within the red rusty fence&#x2014;the longest no longer than my walking stick&#x2014; Thus we had four children to grow to full stature&#x2014;or close to it&#x2014; Thus we came to another war.</p><p>I was a Stephens man from the first, but what possible difference can that make now, to Mr. Stephens or to me?</p><p>I was no Secessionist. Quite the contrary. But dress yourselves in gray, Suthy and Badger and Moses, and be off with your shooting-irons. Scrape the raw white fabric, Lucy. Put up the calves-foot jelly for the wounded, my Veronica. And cry and cry, and read your Bible, and pray again, and cry once more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Mist had condensed thickly after a chilly night, and Ira walked through it like a swimmer moving erect, walking rapidly though lamely, a man with broad round powerful shoulders, and carrying his head tipped forward as if to resist the weight of the flat-brimmed black hat pulled low on his forehead. His brow was channeled horizontally by four distinct wrinkles like deep narrow scars. His pale eyes shone from a covert of long dark lashes and coffee-colored eyebrows. His nose was insignificant, his wide full-lipped mouth the best feature in a round smooth face. Ira Claffey demonstrated the manner of a keen-eyed hunter who was forever on the watch for birds and expected that a covey would go crackling up and out, only a few steps ahead.</p><p>He would have been able to name the week&#x2014;and possibly the day&#x2014;of the year; he would have been able to name it by evidence before him if startled quickly awake from a century&#x2019;s repose. The long-leaved pines themselves, their banks of dark green plush in milky distance, with the outer tips of pine needles touched by autumnal tan, and yet this tan was invisible until you came close. Sunflowers, the little susie flowers still blooming spiritedly; sodden cornfields shrunken merciless, every ragged stalk of fodder soaked with mist; sandy, clayey bare spots in yard and gardens standing out silvery&#x2014;intense spots, never casual, but seeming to have been cleared and stamped recently, and for a special purpose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning, as told by his silver watch, with the sun burning low and solid in a cloudless sky but with farthermost groves still fogged; jack-oaks half green and looking withered and scrofulous; the scrub swamp gums well turned at this date, and some of them burning in artificial pinks; tulip trees half green; some of the buttonwoods verdant as in summer.</p><p>The air hung clammy, but still good because it was wild, unprovoked by many men or their machines or structures. Ira heard the squeal of a train whistle (the service was untidy and uncertain on this Southwestern line from Macon to Americus and Albany. Claffey could not have told you with accuracy just how many trains jounced puffing up and down the line each day; at least he knew that the service was sadly confused because of military necessity) and far above the hill and western pines there frothed some woodsmoke as the cars halted at Anderson Station. Nothing much there except a wretched store, several houses, and a pyramid of old sawdust from Yeoman&#x2019;s mill, no longer operating.</p></p><h2>Terraria: Exploration and Adventure Handbook (Terraria Gaming Guide)</h2><p><p>In Terraria, the size of your world can range from fairly big to absolutely massive!

The first entry in April, in large letters, is &#x2018;KITCHEN CHIMNEY SWEPT&#x2019;. My parents&#x2019; dearest wish was for a big family of boys; a sixth girl was not worth recording. &#x2018;Nancy, Pam, Tom, Diana, Bobo, Decca, me&#x2019;, intoned in a peculiar voice, was my answer to anyone who asked where I came in the family.</p><p>The sisters were at home and Tom was at boarding school for this deeply disappointing event, more like a funeral than a birth. Years later Mabel, our parlourmaid, told me, &#x2018;I knew what it was by your father&#x2019;s face.&#x2019; When the telegram arrived Nancy announced to the others, &#x2018;We Are Seven&#x2019;, and wrote to Muv at our London house, 49 Victoria Road, Kensington, where she was lying-in, &#x2018;How disgusting of the poor darling to go and be a girl.&#x2019; Life went on as though nothing had happened and all agreed that no one, except Nanny, looked at me till I was three months old and then were not especially pleased by what they saw.</p><p>Grandfather Redesdale&#x2019;s huge house and estate in Gloucestershire, Batsford Park near Moreton-in-Marsh, was inherited by my father in 1916. It was too expensive to keep up and was sold in 1919. My father looked for somewhere more modest near Swinbrook, a small village where he owned land, fifteen miles from Batsford. There was no house there suitable for a family of six children and a seventh on the way, so he bought Asthall Manor in the neighbouring village. I was born soon after the move and my earliest recollections are of the ancient house and its immediate surroundings. Asthall is a typical Cotswold manor, hard by the church, with a garden that descends to the River Windrush. It was loved by my sisters and Tom, and the seven years spent there were probably the happiest for parents and children, the proceeds of the sale of Batsford giving the family a feeling of security that was never repeated.</p><p>There was, and is, something profoundly satisfying in the scale of Asthall village. It was a perfect entity where every element was in proportion to the rest: the manor, the vicarage, the school and pub; the farmhouses with their conveniently placed cowsheds and barns; the cottages, whose occupants supplied the labour for the centuries-old jobs that still existed when we were children; and the pigsties, chicken runs and gardens that belonged to the cottages. Before cars and commuters, you lived close to where you worked and the shops came to you in horse-drawn vans. This was the calm background of a self-contained agricultural parish, regulated by the seasons, in an exceptionally beautiful part of England.</p><p>My father planted woods to hold game, as well as a short beech avenue leading up to the house, and his dark purple lilacs outside the garden wall are still growing there after nearly a hundred years. The house itself needed much restoration. My mother&#x2019;s flair for decoration and her talent for home-making ensured that the French furniture and pictures from Batsford were shown at their best. My father installed water-powered electric light &#x2013; just the sort of contraption he adored; drawing heavily on his umpteenth cigarette, he would lean over the engineer, itching to do the job better himself. He made sure he had a child-proof door to his study by putting the handle high up out of reach. Sometimes we heard the voice of Galli-Curci singing Farve&#x2019;s favourite aria, coming loudly from the outsize horn of his gramophone &#x2013; a twin of the one in advertisements for His Master&#x2019;s Voice. In another mood he might put on &#x2018;The Diver&#x2019; (&#x2018;He is now on the surface, he&#x2019;s gasping for breath, so pale that he wants but the stillness of death&#x2019;), sung by Signor Foli in a terrifying and unnaturally low bass voice.</p><p>With foresight, or perhaps by luck, Farve converted the barn a few yards from the house into one large room with four bedrooms above and added a covered passage, &#x2018;the cloisters&#x2019;, to connect the two buildings. Tom and the older sisters lived in the barn, untroubled by grown-ups or babies, and made the most of their freedom. My father, who was famous for having read only one book, White Fang, which he enjoyed so much he vowed never to read another, entrusted Tom, aged ten, with the task of choosing which books to keep from the Batsford library. Nancy and Diana later said that if they had any education, it was due to the unrestricted access they had had to Grandfather&#x2019;s books at Asthall. Later, a grand piano arrived for Tom who showed great musical promise. Music and reading were his passions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The First World War was not long over and life for the survivors was limping back to normal. There was little to record in our family in the first few years of my life. Nancy went to Hatherop Castle, a finishing school nearby, and was taken to Paris with a group of friends, where she first saw the architecture and works of art that inspired in her a lifelong love of that city. She wrote enthusiastic letters to our mother about the shops, the food and the days spent at the Louvre. Pam busied herself with her ponies, pigs and dogs. Tom was at Lockers Park prep school in Hemel Hempstead. His orderly mind was already preparing for a career in the Law and he paid Nancy to argue with him all day during the holidays. Diana was an unwilling Girl Guide and played the organ in church, putting into practice her theory that &#x2018;Tea for Two&#x2019;, if played slowly enough, did very well as a voluntary.</p><p>The years at Asthall passed in a haze of contentment from my point of view. I was aware of The Others but they were so old and seemed to Decca (Jessica, my daily companion) and me to be of another world. It was not until later that I got to know them. Unity, next up in age from Decca and not yet in the schoolroom, made her huge presence felt but, although always kind to me, she was not an intimate. Our life in the nursery consisted of the daily round, the common task, secure and regular as clockwork.</p><p>At the age of five we started lessons with Muv, who followed the admirable Parents&#x2019; National Education Union (PNEU) system with its emphasis on learning through direct contact with nature and good books, and its disapproval of marks, prizes, rewards and exams. She taught us reading, writing and sums, and read us tales from the famous children&#x2019;s history book, Our Island Story. She was a natural teacher and never made anything seem too difficult. At the age of eight, I moved on to the schoolroom and a governess (trained at the PNEU&#x2019;s Ambleside College) and never enjoyed lessons again.</p><p>Our nursery windows overlooked the churchyard with its graves of wool merchants long since dead, the beautiful tombs topped with fleeces carved in stone. We were fascinated by funerals, which we were not meant to watch but of course we did. Decca and I once fell into a newly dug grave, to the delight of Nancy who pronounced fearful bad luck on us for ever. At that age, I was sure Farve would be buried by the path leading to our garden and even today I expect to see his big toe sticking up through the turf, which is what he warned me would happen if I misbehaved.</p><p>Beyond the churchyard to the left were stables, kennels and a garage. Early on at Asthall my father had a horrible accident in the stable yard: he was getting on to a young horse when it reared and fell backwards on to him, breaking his pelvis. The injury did not heal properly and, unable to throw his leg over a saddle, he never rode again. To the right of the churchyard was the vicarage. We adored the vicar&#x2019;s wife and long after we had left Asthall, Pam and I used to ride over and trot briskly up the drive, shouting for ginger biscuits. Across the road was the kitchen garden with its glasshouses and glorious white peaches, reserved strictly for grown-ups. Unity and our cousin Chris Bailey committed the heinous crime of sneaking into the greenhouse and stealing some peaches. There was a stony silence throughout the house while they were reprimanded by my father, which made a big effect on the younger ones. Farve has gone down in history as a violent man, mainly because of Nancy&#x2019;s portrayal of him as the irascible Uncle Matthew in her novels. While he could indeed get angry, he was never physically violent and his bark was far worse than his bite. We would tease him, goad him as far as we dared, until he turned and roared at us.</p><p>As soon as I could walk I shadowed Farve, struggling to keep up. He used to pick me up, throw me on to his shoulder and carry me over winter ditches and summer stinging nettles; the comforting feel of his velveteen waistcoat is inseparable from my memories of him. I must have been a great nuisance, but we saw eye to eye about everything. He took me fishing in the magic moment of the year when the mayfly were hatching and let me carry his net. As time went by, he showed me how to slide it under the hooked trout &#x2013; no talking, no jerking &#x2013; and land it on the bank. The sound of a reel when a line is cast on a trout rod equals early summer to me and the smell of newly cut grass, cow parsley, thrushes and &#x2018;All the birds of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire&#x2019; (Edward Thomas&#x2019;s Adlestrop is not far from Asthall) take me back to our stretch of the Windrush. No health, no safety, no handrail on the single planks that were our bridges as we crossed and recrossed over the river. It was paradise and I knew it. The river water had its own smell that rose from the easily stirred-up mud, and many years later when swimming among the weeds and mud in a pond high above Chatsworth, in the company of moorhens and mallard, nostalgia for the river at Asthall was almost too much and I was six again.</p><p>My father loved the river, described in the estate agent&#x2019;s brochure when Asthall was sold as &#x2018;of the most attractive character to a fisherman, including rapids, ge...</p></p><h2>Twice Yours</h2><p>In this heartwarming retelling of a wonderful old fable about a young boy who made a sailboat, lost it, and bought it back, best-selling author, Nan Gurley, shares what God did for us through the blood of his Son Jesus on Calvary, when were made twice His.

He studied at Leipzig, where he showed interest in the occult, and at Strassburg, where Herder introduced him to Shakespeare&#39;s works and to folk poetry. He produced some essays and lyrical verse, and at twenty-four came to fame as part of the Sturm und Drang movement - a position established on the publication of Werther. Goethe worked on Faust throughout his life, while travelling through Italy and returning to Weimar, where he directed the State Theatre. He died in 1832. Philip Wayne was Headmaster of St Marylebone Grammar School. He translated the complete Faust in two volumes. He died in 1965.</p><h2>Irving J. Gill: Architect, 1870 - 1936</h2><p>Architect Irving J.

In her groundbreaking work Five California Architects, Esther McCoy asserts that, along with Bernard Maybeck, Charles and Henry Greene, and R. M. Schindler, Gill is one of California&#x2c7;s most important architects. This book looks at the life and architectural achievements of Gill, with brilliant photography by Marvin Rand and McCoy&#x2c7;s insightful text from Five California Architects.<br> Additionally, Gill's own writing (excerpted from The Craftsman (1916))describes his architectural and design philosophy. <br> As one of the most influential architects of the late-nineteenth to early twentieth century, Gill is said to have been so far advanced for his time that there was yet no discussion of &#x2248;modernism�&#x2039;it simply had not emerged as a movement or a consciousness. Gill followed no one, choosing instead to lead a paradigm shift from crafts to construction to mechanic building, particularly in light of the development and evolution of concrete as material of choice.<br> The stunning combination of Rand's photographic art and McCoy's writing makes Irving J. Gill an important addition to the library of any serious scholar or fan of Gill, California architecture, Arts and Crafts, modernism, or turn-of-the-century development in building.<br> Marvin Rand gained his photographic education at Los Angeles City College, the U. S. Air Force Photographic School, and Art Center College of Design. He has made a career as an architectural photographer, and his clients have included Charles Eames, Cesar Pelli, Louis Kahn, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Gwathmey/Siegal &amp; Associates, William Pereira &amp; Associates, the Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few. His photographs have been featured in twenty exhibitions&#x2039;from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, and New York&#x2039;and in twenty-three books, including seminal books on Greene and Greene authored by Randell L. Makinson and Five California Architects by Esther McCoy. His first monograph, Greene and Greene, was published in 2005. Rand lives in Marina del Rey, California, with his wife, Mary Ann Danin.<br>Marvin Rand has tried to extend architecture in an art, showing the quality of emotion through light and shadow, using what is in the subject matter-strong line and form. He has been published in numerous books and magazines throughout the world and has been showcased in major exhibitions. Rand lives in Marina del Rey, California.</p>
